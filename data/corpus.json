    "text": "How we use the guide every day\nMost guidelines in this handbook are meant to help, and unless otherwise stated, are meant to help more than being absolute rules. Don't be afraid to do something because you don't know the entire handbook, nobody does. Be gentle when reminding people about these guidelines. For example say, \"It is not a problem, but next time please consider the following guideline from the handbook.\"\nIf you ask a question and someone answers with a link to the handbook, they do this because they want to help by providing more information. They may also be proud that we have the answer documented. It doesn't mean that you should have read the entire handbook, nobody knows the entire handbook.\nIf you need to ask a team member for help, please realize that there is a good chance the majority of the community also doesn't know the answer. Be sure to document the answer to radiate this information to the whole community. After the question is answered, discuss where it should be documented and who will do it. You can remind other people of this request by asking \"Who will document this?\"\nWhen you discuss something in chat always try to link to a URL where relevant. For example, the documentation you have a question about or the page that answered your question. You can remind other people of this by asking \"Can you please link?\"\nRemember, the handbook is not what we hope to do, what we should formally do, or what we did months ago. It is what we do right now. Make sure you change the handbook in order to truly change a process. To propose a change to a process, make a merge request to change the handbook. Don't use another channel to propose a handbook change (email, Google Doc, etc.).\nThe handbook is the process. Any sections with names like 'process', 'policies', 'best practices', or 'standard operating procedures' are an indication of a deeper problem. This may indicate a duplication between a prose description of a process and a numbered list description of the same process that should be combined in one description of the process.\nWhen communicating something always include a link to the relevant (and up-to-date) part of the handbook instead of including the text in the email/chat/etc. You can remind other people of this by asking \"Can you please link to the relevant part of the handbook?\"\nEveryone should subscribe to the #handbook channel to stay up-to-date with changes to the handbook\nAll the information of the handbook are automatically valid also for all the consuntants, contractors and freelance, unless otherwise specified. Since we consider them just as part of the team and the company like any other \"regular\" employee. Obviously, we expect them to embrace AgileLab's values and processes\nHow to change or define a process\nTo change a guideline or process, suggest an edit in the form of a merge request. When you hear about a good idea, you can remind other people of this by asking \"Can you please send a merge request for the handbook?\"\nKeeping up with changes to the Handbook can be difficult, please follow the commit subject guidelines with a particular focus on your merge request's title, to ensure someone reading the Handbook Changelog can quickly understand the MR's content.\nCommunicate process changes by linking to the merged diff (a commit that shows the changes before and after). If you are communicating a change for the purpose of discussion and feedback, it is ok to link to an unmerged diff. Do not change the process first, and then view the documentation as a lower priority task. Planning to do the documentation later inevitably leads to duplicate work communicating the change and it leads to outdated documentation. You can remind other people of this by asking \"Can you please update the handbook first?\"\nLike everything else, our processes are always in flux. Everything is always in draft, and the initial version should be in the handbook, too. If you are proposing a change to the handbook, whenever possible, skip the issue and submit a merge request. (Proposing a change via a merge request is preferred over an issue description). Mention the people that affected by the change in the merge request. In many cases, merge requests are easier to collaborate on since you can see the proposed changes.\nIf something is a limited test to a group of users, add it to the handbook and note as such. Then remove the note once the test is over and every case should use the new process.\nIf someone inside or outside AgileLab makes a good suggestion invite them to add it to the handbook. Send the person the URL of the relevant page and section and offer to do it for them if they can't. Having them make and send the suggestion will make the change and will reflect their knowledge.\nWhen you submit a merge request, make sure that it gets merged quickly. Making single, small changes quickly will ensure your branch doesn't fall far behind master, creating merge conflicts. Aim to make and merge your update on the same day. Mention people in the merge request or reach them via Teams. If you get a suggestion for a large improvement on top of the existing one consider doing that separately. Create an issue, get the existing MR merged, then create a new merge request.\nTry to add the why of a handbook process, what is the business goal, what is the inspiration for this section. Adding the why makes processes easier to change in the future since you can evaluate if the why changed.\nStyle guide and information architecture\nSingle Source of Truth: think about the information architecture to eliminate repetition and have a Single Source of Truth (SSoT). Instead of repeating content cross-link it (each text has a hyperlink to the other piece). If you copy content please remove it at the origin place and replace it with a link to the new content. Duplicate content leads to having to update it in multiple changes, which is a lot of work and very easy to forget. If you forget one of the pieces of content is out of date.\nMake sure to always cross-link items if there are related items (elsewhere in the handbook, in docs, or in issues).\nAvoid unstructured content based on formats like FAQs, lists of links, resource pages, glossaries, courses, videos, tests, or how-to's. These are very hard to keep up-to-date and are not compatible with organization per function and result.\nInstead, put the answer, link, definition, course, video, or test in the most relevant place. Use descriptive headers so that people can easily search for content\nManagement\nIt is each department and team member's responsibility to ensure the handbook stays current. People Operations Specialists will partner with a representative from each department (engineering, marketing, etc). For questions on who to submit a merge request to, or assistance with the handbook, please reach out on the\nBigData/handbook\nTeams channel.\nIf you need permissions to directly merge changes to the handbook, please submit a New Access Request issue and follow the process for access approval.\nAny changes to the handbook as part of this review will be shared in the\nBigData/handbook\nTeams channel.\nMake it worthwhile\nThere are many occasions where something is documented in the knowledge base, but people don't know about it because they never bothered to read or search. Some people have a strong aversion against what they perceive as a 'wall of text'.\nTo ensure that people's time is well spent looking at the handbook we should follow the 'handbook guidelines' above, and also:\nFollow the writing style guide\nHave a great search function\nTest people on their knowledge during onboarding\nGive real examples\nAvoid corporate speak, describe things like you're talking to a friend\nPay attention to privacy and confidentiality\nRemember that the handbook is public and also merge requests are, then please do not share sensitive information like people's identity, financial data, etc.\nHow to locally test a Merge Request\nIt could be useful to test the proposed changes on the Handbook before a MR is marked as \"Ready to review\". This is especially useful if the MR contains a complex Markdown structure that could not potentially be what you expect.\nIt's pretty easy to setup your local environment. In this guide we will assume you are using Ubuntu.\nPrerequisite: npm. If you do not have it, run\nsudo apt install npm\nor search the installation command for your OS.\n# Setup the project environment. This should be done ONLY ONCE. It may require `sudo`\nnpm install\nThis will install all the dependencies and plugins used within the HonKit book.\nFinally, locally start your Honkit instance:\n# Exposes locally on http://localhost:4000 your gitbook\nnpm run serve\nEverytime you make a change in your project, it will automatically refresh the web address with the new content.\nPlugins\nHolaspirit\nWhen mentioning a company's role (e.g. Certification Coach) make sure you link it to the Holaspirit page of the role. \nTo do that our Handbook uses our own Holaspirit plugin. Check the\nusage\nsection of this\npage\nto know how to create a role mention.\nThere is no need to link every single role mention of the same role in the same page, just link the most significant one (usually at the bottom of the page). \nFor instance: if I mention\nCertification Coach\nfor 5 times inside the same page, I will create a Holaspirit link only once."

    "text": "How to contribute\nIn this page you can find a guide on how to use the Gitlab UI to start new issues and create merge requests.\nCreate issues\nWhenever you need information that you can’t find in the Handbook, or you find it but it is unclear or incomplete, you can open an issue to highlight the problem and start a discussion.\nTo open a new issue follow these steps:\nGo to the\nHandbook home page\n.\nSelect the \"Issues\" section in the left column (or select \"Issues\" from the \"Plan\" section in the left column).\nSelect the \"New issue\" button in the top right corner.\nChoose a template in the template dropdown menu:\nbug\nif you want to report something that you think is wrong,\nfeature\nif you would like something to be added or modified.\nEdit the page according to your needs. Remember to use the labels (in the right column) if you want to bring the issue to the attention of some circle (for example HR, training, finance...).\nOnce you are happy with the result, publish your issue by selecting the \"Create issue\" button, in the bottom of the page.\nTo keep track of your issue, you can go to the issue section in the left column, you'll find your issue with an associated number.\nModify the Handbook - Open new branches\nIf you find an issue - your own or someone else's - that you want to solve, you can open a new branch to solve it. To open a new branch and apply your changes you have to:\nSelect \"Branches\" from the \"Code\" section in the left column.\nSelect the \"New branch\" button in the top right corner.\nChoose a branch name and create your branch. As a best practice, start with\nfeature/\nwhen adding or modifying a page, and with\nfix/\nwhen solving a bug. Adding the related issue number in the branch name helps keep the repository organized.\nNow that your branch has been created, you can edit it. Make sure that you are in your branch by checking that the selected branch in the homepage is the one you created.\nSelect the file you want to change and press the \"Edit\" button in the top right corner. Select the \"Edit single file\" option and modify the page according to your needs. The pages are written in Markdown format (.md) — you can find a complete usage guide\nhere\n.\nOnce you are happy with the result, commit your changes by pressing the \"Commit changes\" in the top right corner. Edit the commit message with a brief summary of the changes you made and commit.\nOpen merge requests\nFinally, when you want to integrate your changes to the Handbook you need to open a merge request:\nSelect the \"Merge requests\" section in the left column (or select \"Merge requests\" from the \"Code\" section in the left column).\nPress the \"New merge request\" button in the top right corner.\nSelect as source branch the one you want to merge, then press \"Compare branches and continue\".\nCustomize your merge request: add a clear title and modify the description with a summary of the changes you made. Select the standard template and fill in the necessary fields. Use Labels to notify the relevant circle (for example, HR, Training, Finance). Assign the merge request to the appropriate\nHandbook Maintainer\n; each circle has its own, determined by the label you added. If you are unsure who the Maintainer is, check\nHolaspirit\n. If a circle doesn't have a dedicated Maintainer or the merge request isn't for a specific circle, assign it to the\ncircle:Agile Lab\ncircle\nHandbook Maintainer\n.\nCheck the \"Delete source branch\" box before selecting \"Create merge request\" to make sure that your work branch will be deleted once the changes have been added to the Handbook.\nNow your merge request is ready to be reviewed and merged! An Handbook Maintainer will help you reviewing, resolving any critical issues and merging your proposal."

In the interest of the team's purpose and your responsibilities, you are authorized to do whatever you see fit and which is not expressly forbidden to us.\nTransparency\n:\nThere are no (implicit) expectations among people beyond those we explicitly codify in roles, so we make them visible to everyone so they can clearly interact. Make deliverables, relative priority judgments, completion estimates, actions and projects in charge, relevant to the activities you do, visible to every other team members (either by explicit request or by making them available a priori).\nPeer collaboration\n:\nWe do not give orders to each other, but we hold each other accountable to the responsibilities under our roles, accepting and prioritizing appropriately, when we are engaged, whatever requests come our way if we judge them to be in line with the expectations of our purpose. You have a duty to identify and process the tensions you feel when operating in your roles to solve problems and seize new opportunities.\nEvolutionary learning\n:\nWe have periodic moments of collective reflection and alignment to review in-progress the organization of roles, provide clarification on specific activities, and assign additional activities.\nHow we organize ourselves\nWe are people who, united by a common purpose, wish to collaborate in teams (also called \"Circles\") \nto achieve it.\nPurpose represents the beacon that guides us, the kind of positive contribution our organization\nintends to introduce into the context in which it operates. To achieve it, we mutually assign work to each other by \ndistributing it among well-defined organizational roles, to which we give positive energy through our \nintelligence and initiative. Roles in Agile Lab are not titles or indications of status, but simply \"hats\" \nthat we wear at our discretion and that represent the different types of work that \nthe organization sees fit to do; we, therefore, organize the work and not the people.\nEach circle contains a set of roles, and is itself a role within the circle that contains it\nthus giving rise to a hierarchy of containment and specialization.\nEach person may be assigned one or more roles in different circles; thus, each person may find himself or herself playing multiple roles. Each person may find herself playing multiple roles at once; it will be up to her to choose to devote her  attention, from time to time, to the one in which at any given time it will make the most sense to dress for the good of the team or the entire organization.\nAll roles are created, changed, and deleted independently by us in dedicated meetings (called Governance meetings), but each circle must mandatorily contain 3 that are predetermined and necessary for the smooth functioning of the team itself regardless of the work it is to perform:\nthe\nCircle Lead\n(appointed by the Circle Lead of the upper circle, if any) with liaison functions between the team and the rest of the organization,\nthe\nSecretary\n(elected)\nthe\nFacilitator\n(elected).\nThese last two roles both have the function of chairing the meetings and governance.\nIt is not possible to add responsibilities to the Circle Lead beyond those initially prescribed (but they can be taken away through \ngovernance proposals and assigned to other roles or processes). It is possible to add responsibilities to \nall other predefined roles, but not remove their native responsibilities. The responsibilities of these \nroles are detailed in the \"PREDEFINED ROLES\" section.\nThe team has two collective meeting times called the Governance Meeting and the Tactical Meeting, these are scheduled periodically by the secretary and facilitated by the facilitator.\nThe Tactical Meeting is a time for monitoring and assigning activities and projects, which has the goal of engaging each other to \nthe goal by working IN THE team\nThe Governance Meeting is a time devoted to redefining rules and responsibilities, it is a time when we come together to reflect on the way we work, that is we work ON THE team\nHow we work and evolve together\nAny initiative of a role is determined by the presence of a tension: the perception, on the part of the person filling it, of a difference between the current state of things and a future state which is valued as better.\nThis need to resolve tensions can give rise to an initiative to change the state of things in three ways:\nEngaging ourselves or others in their respective roles, on timely outcomes that we deem worthwhile obtain,\nCreating/changing ongoing expectations (roles and responsibilities) through appropriate proposals for change,\nBy placing constraints on our mutual freedom of action.\nWe prioritize actions (the timely-tactical results), but every now and then we pause to reflect together \nto try to make even clearer the mutual expectations on the basis of which we engage (the \nongoing expectations, governance of roles and responsibilities), while at the same time trying to \nminimize the limits we place on our freedom (governance of constraints)\nWhen we act, or propose changes to expectations and limits we are guided by two principles:\nGood enough for now: to all-encompassing changes based on theory, we prefer proposals that aim for a tangible benefit on the basis of which new further proposals, building on a newly acquired base of awareness\nSafe enough to try: We prefer to prioritize changes that do not involve irreversible risks or too difficult to mitigate, waiting for new awareness to allows us to pursue the other options more clearly.\nPoint results\nThey are expectations that have an 'anticipable definition of outcome and thus a finite time duration \n(but not necessarily known in advance) on which we engage from time to time, bind us to an output \nbut not to the manner in which we will obtain it nor to the time we consider necessary to obtain it, we call them\nactions\nand\nprojects\n(tactical expectations), they can be requested, created and assigned at any \ntime. And that is why\neverything that is done in the Tactical Meeting can also be done outside \noutside of it\n.\nOur results are of three kinds:\nProject assigned to a role\n: it represents an outcome for which a \"definition of \ndone\" expressed in the past participle (this is the condition we will test to see if it has actually been \nconcluded), even if we do not know in advance what actions it will require to be achieved. (Ex: \n\"software version 2.0 released\"), is created by mutual engagement between roles\nAction assigned to a role\n: any atomic activity we might undertake in any of our roles, \neven immediately in the absence of different priorities, and that does not need further clarification/reflection on what \nthat is to be done, nor to be broken down into further actions (e.g., \"contact supplier xyz to ask him for a \n10% discount\"-for a hypothetical \"Contract Management\" role), like the project, it too is \ncreated by mutual engagement between roles.\nAction/Project assigned to individuals\n: an action or project that in the absence of natural attribution to an \nexisting role is undertaken by a person to serve the purpose of his or her team or organization (e.g., \"buying paper for the printer\"- by any person on the team in the absence of a role responsible for supplying the team with stationery). Where repeated or \nrecurrent, it will be our care to take to the appropriate venues the tensions that will allow us to give dignity \norganizational dignity to such actions, so that they occur within the framework of the organization itself (and thus are \nattributable to a role) and are not intentional on a purely personal level (ex: in this case, we need a \nrole that regularly presides over stationery supplies?)\nContinuous expectations\nThese are expectations that do not have a limited time duration, but are valid indefinitely, at least until they change. Continuous expectations allow us to make clear how and to whom we need to address the requests for discrete results -> these are the roles themselves and their responsibilities. Continuous expectations can be created or modified only during the Governance meetings. Continuous expectations are divided into:\nResponsibilities\n: an activity with some form of periodicity that our team has a need for over time (example: “keep document xyz up to date”)\nRoles\n: every role is a collection of synergic and homogeneous responsibilities that are assigned to one or more people such that they make the associated actions part of their daily operation.\nConstraints\nConstraints are the tools we use when we want to constrain the modes through which we obtain the discrete results or generate continuous expectations. These are “specific ways of doing things” with which we want to limit our freedom of operation. Constraints are of two types:\nDomains\n: are the property of a physical or abstract asset (also procedures, processes, interactions), that we want to assign exclusively to a specific role. The assignee of a domain manages it as they see fit, but they are bound to take into consideration the requests from colleagues to access the domain.\nPolicies\n: are rules that:\nLimit the authority of one or more roles\nDefines the way in which the role governing a domain grants or restricts access to other roles\nDetermines that some condition must trigger a specific action (or start a process)\nIn the same way as continuous expectations, constraints may only be created/modified during governance meetings.\nNothing that is done in a governance meeting can be done outside of it.\nHow we operate individually\nRules\nIf it is not forbidden then it is allowed: anything that has not been explicitly forbidden (through appropriate constraints) is allowed, even when out of the scope of the roles assigned to us, as long as it is aligned with the purpose of the team and the whole organisation.\nIf it is not explicit then nobody can expect it from a role or a person: no implicit expectation (unwritten) has any value for us besides that which governance prescribes, we use governance to gain better clarity over that which we expect to be done by others.\nNobody manages the others: no role or person has power over other roles or people, it is for this reason that activities are generated from the intersection of needs, attention, availability and action capabilities rather than because someone order it to be done.\nAll previous rules are valid until overwritten: any explicit rule pre dating the adoption of this document remains valid unless:\nIt contradicts the contents and principles of this document (example: “the people in the team report to manager x” is automatically voided by the new ways of collaboration prescribed by this self management document)\nIt is overwritten by a new rule produced by acts of governance following the processes described in this document\nResponsibilities\nWe abide by 4 responsibilities towards our colleagues: “listen and reply”, “transparency”, “processing requests”, “traceability”\nBelow we illustrate a more detailed explanation:\nDuty to listen and to reply\nWe have the duty to continuously reflect on our work, to identify new tensions towards improvement and attempt to solve them by triggering actions/projects/changes of expectations.\nWe resolve tensions through direct personal initiative or by interacting with other roles or by taking them to a tactical or governance meeting so that they can be resolved.\nDuty of transparency\nEvery member of the team can expect from others (and vice versa):\nTransparency about projects and actions undertaken\nOur personal judgement about the relative importance we give to the projects assigned to us\nAn estimate of completion given our priorities\nUseful questions:\n“Which next step have you identified to achieve this result?”\n“What other priorities do you have now?”\nProcessing requests:\nWe have the duty to take charge of the requests from those who engage us in our roles, adding the suggested actions or projects in our personal or company system of traceability. When we disagree with an engagement we cannot simply refuse it, instead we have to suggest alternative paths to resolve the tension that generated the engagement.\nAccepting does not mean executing immediately, it means assigning a relative priority for handling these new requests. The duty of transparency will resolve emerging doubts and the Circle Lead may ask us to modify the priorities we assign to the tasks we are engaged in.\nIf our roles have domains, we have the duty to take into consideration the requests from other roles to act on those domains.\nUseful questions:\n“Would taking charge of this action or project be in service of your role given its purpose and responsibilities?”\n“Which project or next action have you identified for that responsibility?”\n“Are you able to process this responsibility? What is blocking you?”\nTraceability\nWe keep track of every action/project we take on in our team at least until it has been completed.\nWe use a computer tool accessible to the entire team (example: holaspirit) for projects and actions which we think are useful to make visible to other roles. For tracing all other activities, each one of us can choose the tool they prefer that will be instrumental in accomplishing the duties of transparency, processing and traceability.\nMetrics and checklists\nWe adopt two transparency tools for increasing the visibility of the progress in our activities. These are metrics and checklists.\nA metric represents a measure that can be assigned or removed from a role by the circle lead. The task of the role that is assigned a metric is to curate it and share it with a determined regularity (example: \"number of active clients in the past month\"). It is up to the role to choose the proper tools to aggregate and present the data. The assignment of a metric does not need to be accompanied by the creation of new role responsibilities. A metric implicitly assumes the expectation to periodically execute all the actions necessary to produce it.\nA checklist is a binary check (check / no check) on all responsibilities over a given time frame, verifying whether they were executed or not (example: \"monthly backup of database executed\"). Since a checklist does not involve any additional work with respect to what is already assumed by our responsibilities it can be requested by/to any role.\nPredefined roles\nFacilitator\nPurpose: ensure that the governance of the circle and the activities conducted in it are aligned to the constitution.\nResponsibilities:\nFacilitate the circle meetings mandated by the constitution\nOn request, conduct auditing of sub-circle practices\nSecretary:\nPurpose: manage the acts of governance of the circle guaranteeing the process of registering and conserving\nResponsibilities:\nSchedule the circle meetings and notify all circle members about the time and place\nVerbalise and publish some output for the circle meetings mandated by the constitution; maintain a high level view over circle governance, check lists and metrics\nInterpret acts of governance and the constitution on request\nDomain: All circle data whose conservation is mandated by the constitution.\nCircle lead\nPurpose: to be guarantor of the circle's purpose\nResponsibilities:\nAssign colleagues to circle roles; monitor the assignee's level of fit to the role they cover; provide feedback aimed at improving the partner's fit to their role; reassign the role when necessary to guarantee the best fit.\nAllocate circle resources to projects and roles.\nDecide priorities and strategies for the circle.\nDefine the circle's metrics.\nDomain: Assignment of roles within the circle.\nAssignment of people to roles\nThe roles of secretary and facilitator are elected while the role of circle lead and all the roles defined by the circle through governance activities are assigned (the default mechanism is that the circle lead assigned persons to the roles within the circle, including the circle leads of subordinate circles). These mechanisms of role assignment may be changed by creating relevant policies.\nWhoever is assigned the role of circle lead can not hold the role of facilitator at the same time.\nThe elected roles are assigned through the following process, which is triggered at the expiration of a mandate or by an explicit request during governance meetings from any participant.\nThe facilitator in charge describes the characteristics of the role for which the election is required (responsibilities and duration of the mandate)\nEach voter fills out the election forms with their name and the name of the chosen candidate (it is possible to vote for yourself)\nThe facilitator gathers and reads the forms.\nThe facilitator asks each voter for the reason of their choice and if they want to change it given the reasons given by the others.\nThe facilitator announces the person who gathered the most votes and proposes that they be elected.\nRound of objections\nIn case of objections the facilitator can decide to repeat the election or to propose a second candidate.\nIn case of a tie the facilitator can choose the person who brought forth their own candidacy, if any. Alternatively they can choose a name at their discretion.\nTIPS\nTo make it easier to apply the principle and rules listed here are some personal reflection/decision cards that can help to handle common cases:\nI would like to attempt an action, can I do it?\nI am asked to do some actions, do I have to do them?\nI would like somebody else to do something, how can I ask them?\nAgilelab meeting structure\nWe have two moments of synchronization and collective decision-making where we process all tensions that cannot be resolved through role to role interaction.\nTactical meeting: serves to process operational tensions by monitoring checklists, metrics and projects and to mutually engage each other by assigning actions and projects. Everything done in the tactical meeting can also be done outside of this meeting.\nGovernance meeting: serves to process organisational tensions and to create/modify/eliminate roles/circles/domains/policies.

A concern becomes an objection when it is determined to satisfy the validity criteria, then it must be resolved before the new proposal can be adopted. An objection is a stated logical reason why the proposal causes harm, it must satisfy the validity criteria in order to maintain the integrity of the scope of governance. It is never wrong to raise invalid objections.\nThe role of the objector is to provide arguments for why their concern meets the validity criteria. The role of the facilitator is to capture the objections in the same way as they capture proposals: they do not have to fact-check, but to judge the structure of the reasoning. An objection is like a tension, the objector determines whether it is validated or not.\nFollowing are some examples of tests for a concern:\nDoes the proposal damage the circle's ability to express its purpose?\nIf adopting this proposal damages a team, the concern could be an objection, ask the next question\nIf you think that the proposal is incomplete or useless, the concern is not a valid objection\nDoes this proposal generate new tensions?\nIf the tension comes directly from this proposal, the concern could be an objection, ask the next question\nIf your preoccupation would persist even if the proposal were abandoned, the concern is not a valid objection\nIs the impact that you are anticipating certain or hypothetical?\nIf you know for sure that this proposal would generate an impact, the concern could be an objection, ask the next question\nIf you are anticipating that there could be an impact, but there isn't enough information yet, ask the follow-up question: :\nIf the proposal doesn't go as planned and creates harm, will it be too late to fix it?\nIf it would be too late to avoid damage by the time we gather enough information, the concern could be an objection, ask the next question\nIf we can give this proposal a try knowing that we can revisit it anytime in the future, the concern is not a valid objection\nDoes this proposal limit one of your roles?\nIf this proposal would limit a role that you cover, the concern could be an objection, ask the next question\nIf you are trying to help another role or a team member with your objection, the concern is not a valid objection\nIn any case an objection is automatically valid if the proposal violates the rules of the constitution."

    "url": "https://handbook.agilelab.it/Values.html",
    "title": "About our Values",
    "section": "Company",
    "level": "1.2.2",
    "text": "About our Values\nWe take inspiration from other companies and we continually adjust our values to create a better workplace for everyone.\nCollaboration\nHelping others is a priority, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that you are trying to achieve. Similarly, you can rely on others for help and advice—in fact, you're expected to do so. Anyone can chime in on any subject, including people who don't work at Agile Lab. The person who's responsible for the work decides how to do it, but they should always take each suggestion seriously and try to respond and explain why it may or may not have been implemented.\nKindness\nWe value caring for others. Demonstrating we care for people provides an effective framework for challenging directly and delivering feedback. We're all for accurate assessment, but we think it must be done kindly. Give as much positive feedback as you can, and do it in a public way, for example in our #thanks channel.\nShare\nThere are aspects of Agile Lab culture, such as extreme transparency, that are unintuitive to outsiders and new team members. Be willing to invest in people and engage in open dialogue. For example, consider making private issues public wherever possible so that we can all learn from the experience.\nNegative is 1-1\nGive negative feedback in the smallest setting possible. One-on-one video calls or live meeting are preferred.\nAvoid negative talking about people that are not involved in the discussion. In negative feedback, we should be specific about what the problem is. For example, saying someone is \"not living the values\" isn't helpful.\nSay thanks\nRecognize the people that helped you publicly.\nGive feedback effectively\nGiving feedback is challenging, but it's important to deliver it effectively. When providing feedback, always make it about the work itself; focus on the business impact and not the person. Make sure to provide at least one clear and recent example. \nIf a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account. An example of giving positive feedback is our thanks chat channel. For managers, it's important to realize that employees react to a negative incident with their managers six times more strongly than they do to a positive one. Keeping that in mind, if an error is so inconsequential that the value gained from providing criticism is low, it might make sense to keep that feedback to yourself. In situations where negative feedback must be given, focus on the purpose of that feedback: to improve the employee’s performance going forward. Give recognition generously, in the open, and often to generate more engagement from your team.\nGet to know each other\nWe use a lot of text-based communication, and if you know the person behind the text, it will be easier to prevent conflicts. So we encourage people to get to know each other on a personal level through our company meetings or 1-1 video calls.\nDon't pull rank\nIf you have to remind someone of the position you have in the company, you're doing something wrong. People already know our decision-making process. Explain why you're making the decision, and respect everyone irrespective of their function.\nAssume positive intent\nWe naturally have a double standard when it comes to the actions of others. We blame circumstances for our own mistakes, but individuals for theirs. This double standard is called the Fundamental Attribution Error. To mitigate this bias, you should always assume positive intent in your interactions with others, respecting their expertise and giving them grace in the face of what you might perceive as mistakes.\nAddress behavior, but don't label people\nThere is a lot of good in this article about not wanting jerks on our team, but we believe that jerk is a label for behavior rather than an inherent classification of a person. We avoid classifications.\nSay sorry\nIf you made a mistake, apologize. Saying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength. The people that do the most work will likely make the most mistakes. Additionally, when we share our mistakes and bring attention to them, others can learn from us, and the same mistake is less likely to be repeated by someone else.\nNo ego\nDon't defend a point to win an argument or double-down on a mistake. You are not your work; you don't have to defend your point. You do have to search for the right answer with help from others.\nPeople are not their work\nAlways make suggestions about examples of work, not the person. Say, \"you didn't respond to my feedback about the design\" instead of \"you never listen\". And, when receiving feedback, keep in mind that feedback is the best way to improve and that others want to see you succeed.\nDo it yourself\nOur collaboration value is about helping each other when we have questions, need critique, or need help. No need to brainstorm, wait for consensus, or do with two what you can do yourself.\nBlameless problem solving\nInvestigate mistakes in a way that focuses on the situational aspects of a failure’s mechanism and the decision-making process that led to the failure rather than cast blame on a person or team. We hold blameless root cause analyses and retrospectives for stakeholders to speak up without fear of punishment or retribution.\nShort toes\nPeople joining the company frequently say, \"I don't want to step on anyone's toes.\" At Agile Lab we should be more accepting of people taking initiative in trying to improve things. As companies grow their speed of decision making goes down since there are more people involved. We should counteract that by having short toes and feel comfortable letting others contribute to our domain.\nIt's impossible to know everything\nWe know we must rely on others for the expertise they have that we don't. It's ok to admit you don't know something and to ask for help, even if doing so makes you feel vulnerable. It is never too late to ask a question, and by doing so you can get the information you need to produce results and to strengthen your skills as well as Agile Lab as a whole. After your question is answered, please document the answer so that it can be shared.\nTrust\nWe don't just trust people to obey the rules, wee also trust that they know when to break rules. The rules are there for normal operations, they are designed to avoid danger and to help ensure that things go smoothly. And though there are guidelines for how to deal with emergencies, at the end of the day, we trust the expertise of our people to know when to break the rules. We can't trust rules or this handbook, we can rely on them but trust is a human experience and can be real only among people. We break rules only when it is the right thing to do for others or for the company, never for personal gain.\nUniversality\nWhile our story has begun in Italy, we are an international company whose reach is not bounded by geography. With respect to that, we have adopted English as the company official language and preferred way of communicating, both externally and internally.\nResults\nWe do what we promised to each other, customers, users, and investors.\nMeasure results not hours\nWe care about what you achieve; the code you shipped, the customer you made happy, and the team member you helped. Someone who took the afternoon off shouldn't feel like they did something wrong. You don't have to defend how you spend your day. We trust team members to do the right thing instead of having rigid rules. Do not incite competition by proclaiming how many hours you worked yesterday. If you are working too many hours talk to your manager to discuss solutions, unless this is your initiative.\nWhen you work on site side by side with the customer, consider that may be the customer doesn't share this value and we need to adapt to its policy.\nGrowth mindset\nYou don't always get results and this will result in criticism from yourself and/or others. We believe our talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others. We try to hire people based on their trajectory, not their pedigree.\nGlobal optimization\nOur definition of global optimization is that you do what is best for the organization as a whole. Don't optimize for the goals of your team when it negatively impacts the goals of other teams, our users, and/or the company. Those goals are also your problem and your job. Keep your team as lean as possible, and help other teams achieve their goals. In the context of collaboration, this means that if anyone is blocked by you, on a question, your approval, or a merge request review, your top priority is always to unblock them, either directly or through helping them find someone else who can, even if this takes time away from your own or your team's priorities.\nTenacity\nWe refer to this as \"persistence of purpose\". As talked about in The Influence Blog, tenacity is the ability to display commitment to what you believe in. You keep picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and quickly get going again having learned a little more.\nOwnership\nWe expect team members to complete tasks that they are assigned. Having a task means you are responsible for anticipating and solving problems. As an owner, you are responsible for overcoming challenges, not suppliers, or other team members. Take initiative and pro-actively inform stakeholders when there is something you might not be able to solve.\nSense of urgency\nAt an exponentially scaling startup time gained or lost has compounding effects. Try to get the results as fast as possible so the compounding of results can begin and we can focus on the next improvement.\nAmbitious\nWhile we iterate with small changes, we strive for large, ambitious results.\nPerseverance\nWorking at Agile Lab will expose you to situations of various levels of difficulty and complexity. This requires focus, and the ability to defer gratification. We value the ability to maintain focus and motivation when work is tough and asking for help when needed.\nBias for Action\nIt's important that we keep our focus on action, and don't fall into the trap of analysis paralysis or sticking to a slow, quiet path without risk. Decisions should be thoughtful, but delivering fast results requires the fearless acceptance of occasionally making mistakes; our bias for action also allows us to course-correct quickly.\nAccepting Uncertainty\nThe ability to accept that there are things that we don’t know about the work we’re trying to do, and that the best way to drive out that uncertainty is not by layering analysis and conjecture over it, but rather accepting it and moving forward, driving it out as we go along. Wrong solutions can be fixed, but non-existent ones aren’t adjustable at all.\nCustomer results\nOur focus is to improve the results that we deliver to customers.\nEfficiency\nWrite things down\nWe document everything: in the handbook, in meeting notes, in issues. We do that because \"the faintest pencil is better than the sharpest memory.\" It is far more efficient to read a document at your convenience than to have to ask and explain. Having something in version control also lets everyone contribute suggestions to improve it.\nBoring solutions\nUse the simplest and most boring solution for a problem, and remember that “boring” should not be conflated with “bad” or “technical debt.” The speed of innovation for our organization and product is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps. Don’t pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun; using established, popular tech will ensure a more stable and more familiar experience for you and other contributors.\nEfficiency for the right group\nOptimize solutions globally for the broader Agile Lab. Making a process efficient for one person or a small group may not be an efficient outcome for the whole Agile Lab. As an example, it may be best to choose a solution for making things slightly less handy for you to develop while making things massively more efficient for the customers.\nBe respectful of others' time\nConsider the time investment you are asking others to make with meetings and a permission process. Try to avoid meetings, and if one is necessary, try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible. Any meeting should have an agenda linked from the invite, and you should document the outcome. Instead of having people ask permission, trust their judgment and offer a consultation process if they have questions.\nSpend company money like it's your own\nEvery dollar we spend will have to be earned back; be as frugal with company money as you are with your own.\nFrugality\nAmazon states it best with: \"Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.\"\nManagers of one\nWe want each team member to be a manager of one who doesn't need daily check-ins to achieve their goals.\nResponsibility over rigidity\nWhen possible we give people the responsibility to make a decision and hold them accountable for that instead of imposing rules and approval processes.\nAccept mistakes\nNot every problem should lead to a new process to prevent them. Additional processes make all actions more inefficient, a mistake only affects one.\nMove fast by shipping the minimum viable change\nWe value constant improvement by iterating quickly, month after month. If a task is too big to deliver in one month, cut the scope.\nInclusion and Work Life Balance\nBuilding a safe community\nEveryone has the right to feel safe when working for Agile Lab. We do not tolerate abuse, harassment, exclusion, discrimination or retaliation by/of any employees.\nFamily and friends first, work second\nLong lasting relationships are the rocks of life and come before work.\nWorking in Agile Lab is not a marriage\nWe encourage a high level of friendship in the company that will survive when you will leave the company\nUnconscious bias\nWe recognize that unconscious bias is something that affects everyone and that the effect it has on us as humans and our company is large. We are responsible for understanding our own implicit biases and helping others understand theirs. We are continuously working on getting better at this topic\nSee Something, Say Something\nAs a globally dispersed company, we have employees from many different backgrounds and cultures. That means it is important for each of us to use great judgment in being respectful and inclusive of our teammates. At the same time, we may sometimes not fully realize we have said or done something to offend someone. It is important that our teammates hold each other accountable and let them know if they have unintentionally or intentionally done something so they can learn and gain additional understanding of perspectives different from our own. It is also important that our teammates don't feel excluded or minimized by the words we use or the things we do. Thus, we all need to speak up when we see something that isn't respectful or inclusive\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging\nDiversity, inclusion and belonging are fundamental to the success of Agile Lab. We aim to make a significant impact in our efforts to foster an environment where everyone can thrive. We are designing a multidimensional approach to ensure that Agile Lab is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute. We actively chose to build and institutionalize a culture that is inclusive and supports all team members equally in the process of achieving their professional goals. \nWe work to make everyone feel welcome and to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities and nationalities in our community and company.\nBias towards asynchronous communication\nTake initiative to operate asynchronously whenever possible. This shows care and consideration for those who may not be in the same time zone, are traveling outside of their usual time zone, or are structuring their day around pressing commitments at home or in their community.\nUnderstanding the impact of microaggressions\nMicroaggressions are much more than merely rude or insensitive comments. They can wear people down by slowly chipping away their sense of belonging/safety/inclusion over time. What is a microaggression?\n“The everyday slights, indignities, put downs and insults that people of color, women, LGBT populations or those who are marginalized experiences in their day-to-day interactions with people.” - Derald W. Sue\nAt Agile Lab we believe that everyone is entitled to a safe working space where they can express who they are and participate in conversations without worry of being spoken to in a harmful way, given that we want to encourage everyone to be mindful of what is a microaggression and be mindful of their potential impact.\nCulture fit is a bad excuse\nWe don’t hire based on culture or select candidates because we’d like to have a drink with them. We hire and reward team members based on our shared values as detailed on this page. We want a values fit, not a culture fit. We want cultural diversity instead of cultural conformity, such as a brogrammer atmosphere. Said differently: “culture add” > “culture fit” or “hire for culture contribution” since our mission is that everyone can contribute.\nReligion and politics at work\nWe generally avoid discussing politics or religion in public forums because it is easy to alienate people that have a minority opinion. This doesn’t mean we never discuss these topics. Because we value diversity, inclusion and belonging, and want all team members to feel welcome and contribute equally, we encourage free discussion of operational decisions that can move us toward being a more inclusive company. \nWhile it is acceptable for individuals to bring up politics and religion in social contexts such as coffee chats and real-life meetups with other coworkers (with the goal to understand and not judge), always be aware of potential sensitivities, exercise your best judgment, and make sure you stay within the boundaries of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nBuilding a safe community\nDo not make jokes or unfriendly remarks about characteristics of the people who make up Agile lab and how they identify. Everyone has the right to feel safe when working for Agile Lab and/or as a part of the Agile Lab community. We do not tolerate abuse, harassment, exclusion, discrimination, or retaliation by/of any community members, including our team members. You can always refuse to deal with people who treat you badly and get out of situations that make you feel uncomfortable.\nUnconscious bias\nWe recognize that unconscious bias is something that affects everyone and that the effect it has on us as humans and our company is large. We are responsible for understanding our own implicit biases and helping others understand theirs. We are continuously working on getting better at this topic.\nIteration\nSomething is better than nothing\nDon't wait\nDon’t wait. When you have something of value for Agile Lab goals, do/say it. Right now everything is fresh in your head and you have the motivation, inspiration is perishable. Don’t wait until you have a better version.\nMake a proposal\nIf you need to decide something as a team, make a concrete proposal instead of calling a meeting to get everyone's input. Having a proposal will be a much more effective use of everyone's time. Every meeting should be a review of a proposal. We should be brainwriting on our own instead of brainstorming out loud. State the underlying problem so that people have enough context to propose reasonable alternatives. The people that receive the proposal should not feel left out and the person making it should not feel bad if a completely different proposal is implemented. Don't let your desire to be involved early or to see your solution implemented stand in the way of getting to the best outcome. If you don't have a proposal don't let that stop you from highlighting a problem, please state that you couldn't think of a good solution and list any solutions you considered.\nFocus on Improvement\nWe believe great companies sound negative because they focus on what they can improve, not on what is working. Our first question in every conversation with someone outside the company should be: what do you think we can improve? This doesn't mean we don't recognize our successes.\nRework is not evil\nDon't be afraid or bored to rework something already done, because nothing is 100% done.\nWhen we iterate slowly\nIn some cases, rapid iteration can get in the way of results. For example when defining and proposing solutions to the customer ( where consistency is key), fixing due dates and deliverables and this values page. In those instances we add additional review to the approval process, not to prohibit, but to be more deliberate in our iteration.\nTransparency\nDirectness\nBeing direct is about being transparent with each other. We try to channel our inner Ben Horowitz by being both straightforward and kind, an uncommon cocktail of no-bullshit and no-asshole. Feedback is always about your work and not your person. That doesn't mean it will be easy to give nor receive it.\nSurface issues constructively\nBe transparent to the right people (up) at the right time (when still actionable)\nAnyone and anything can be questioned\nAny past decisions and guidelines are open to questioning as long as you act following them until they are changed.\nDisagree, commit, and disagree\nEverything can be questioned but as long as a decision is in place we expect people to commit to executing it, which is a common principle. Every decision can be changed, our best decision was one that changed an earlier one. When you want to reopen the conversation on something, show that your argument is informed by previous conversations. You have to achieve results on every decision while it stands, even when you are trying to have it changed. You should communicate with the person who can change the decision instead of someone who can't.\nAccountability\nIncreases accountability when making decisions and difficult choices. Be respectful of other people accountabilities.\nFive dysfunctions\nOur values help us to prevent the five dysfunctions.\nAbsence of trust\n: Unwilling to be vulnerable within the group => prevented by collaboration, specifically kindness\nFear of conflict\n: Seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate => prevented by transparency, specifically directness and collaboration, specifically short toes\nLack of commitment\n: Feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization => prevented by transparency, specifically directness\nAvoidance of accountability\n: Ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards => prevented by results, iteration, and transparency\nInattention to results\n: Focusing on personal success, status, and ego before team success => prevented by results\nSome dysfunctions are not addressed directly by our values, for example trust is not one of our values. Similar to happiness, trust is something that is an outcome, not something you can strive for directly. We hope that the way we work and our values will instill trust, instead of mandating it from people; trust is earned, not given.\nWhy have values\nOur values should give guidelines on how to behave and must be actionable. They help us describe the type of behavior that we expect from people we hire. They help us to know how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others. Values are a framework for distributed decision making; they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager.\nPermission to play\nFrom our values we excluded some obvious behaviors, we call them our permission to play behavior:\nBe truthful and honest.\nBe dependable, reliable, fair, and respectful.\nBe committed, creative, inspiring, and passionate.\nBe deserving of the trust of our users and customers.\nAct in the best interest of the company, our team members, our customers, users, and investors.\nAct in accordance with the law.\nDon't show favoritism as it breeds resentment, destroys employee morale, and creates disincentives for good performance. Seek out ways to be fair to everyone."

    "text": "By adopting the OKR methodology, Agile Lab goes beyond the well-known limits of most organizations which are based on a\ncommand-and-control\nmodel.\nAs a matter of fact, most of the traditional organizations deal with\nslow decision-making processes, difficulties in keeping a high level of innovation, and a lack of employees' commitment and ownership.\nWhat are OKRs?\nOKR\nOKR (Objective and Key Result)\nis a goal-setting framework conceived to spread the company's strategy among employees and to support the efficiency in the execution of tasks with a transparent and collaborative approach.\nFrom a historical point of view, the OKR method is generally attributed to Andrew Grove, who introduced it to Intel during his tenure and later to John Doerr at Google.\nAs the name suggests, an OKR is made of an\nobjective\nand some\nkey results\nthe\nobjective\ndescribes the company priorities in the short term, consistently with the company purpose and the long-term vision.\nThis is the\noutcome\nof the process since it explains \"what\" we want to achieve.\nkey results\nare a list of results that must be numeric, measurable, and linked to the objective.

Ideally, one objective could be more aspirational and the other one more technical.\nThe cycle should last from 3 to 6 months.\nA good objective should be:\nfeasible in one cycle\nshared among the organization members\ninspirational and not numeric\nclearly in line with the company business\nchallenging, but realistic\nunder the team's control\nin the form \"\nverb\n+\nwhat\ndo you want to reach +\nwhy\n+ the application field\"\nGood key results should:\nbe measurable on a weekly basis\nnot be binary\nnot exceed the number of 3-4 per objective\nclearly show how close the goal is\nbe limited to the only ones useful to reach the target\nrepresents 100% of the objective\nnot be influenced by external actors and dependencies\nin the form \"\nverb\n+\nwhat\nwill be measured + the\nextension\nof the result [owner]\"\nThis is an example of a good OKR:\nOBJ: Increase the employees' digital skills to sustain the ongoing digital transformation process of the company and to reduce costs by the end of June\nKR1: Write a gap-analysis document with x pages comparing the internal skills to the ones of the reference market [owner: Training]\nKR2: Reduce digital experts' turnover from x% to y% [owner: Peopleops]\nKR3: Hire x digital experts [owner: HR]\nKRn: ...\nCascading OKR\nOne of the most powerful aspects of the OKR framework is the ability to align each employee's effort and decision, from the front line through the most operational areas to the company strategy.\nThis is possible because\na key result of the higher level becomes an objective of the lower level\n. \nThese are called\ncascading\nOKR\nCompany OKRs\nare at the top level and\nTeam OKRs\nare at the lower level.\nEvery company should choose the correct number of cascading levels according to their cultural and organizational patterns: \nsome organizations use more OKR levels, others can choose to not use cascading OKRs at all.\nTypes of OKRs\nMany organizations (e.g. Google) divide two types of OKRs:\ncommitted\nand\naspirational\n. \nThey have different purposes and they can be designed, interpreted, and acted upon in different ways.\nCommitted\nThese are goals that have to be reached in order to achieve the objective.\nEveryone at the organization and at the team level recognise that they must be met in full. In general, committed OKRs are to be achieved within a set time frame.\nFor example, if the objective states \"To become partner of a vendor\" and the vendor requires at least a minimum number of certifications, the \"achieve 10 certifications\" is a committed OKR because it must be totally achieved.\nAspirational\nOn the other hand, aspirational OKRs reflect bigger-picture, higher-risk and more future-tilting ideas. They show how we’d like the world to look. They are sometimes called\n10x goals\nor\nmoonshots\n.\nRegarding aspirational OKRs, Larry Page said \"If you set a crazy, ambitious goal and miss it, you’ll still achieve something remarkable.”\nWith aspirational OKRs, there is no clear path to  get there—and no real knowledge of what resources will be required.\nThe expected success score of an aspirational OKR is 70%.\nThe relative weighting of these two types of OKRs is a cultural question.\nOKR process in Agile Lab\nThere is no ‘one size fits all’ OKR process that works for each company.\nTherefore, Agile Lab adopted the framework crafting its own process and improving it cycle after cycle.\nThe\nAgile Lab/OKR Champion\nis in charge of the process milestones, timelines and outcomes.\nThis is a 10.000 foot-view of the OKR cycle timeline:\nComplete OKR cycle in Agile Lab.\nIntroduction\nIn our company, each OKR cycle involves three groups with different responsibilities:\nTeams\n: All Circles\nDepartments\n: All Circles that are directly included in the Global Company Circle (1st level only)\nShareholders\n: Individuals or companies that own shares in Agile Lab\nA\nCycle\nconsists of 4 stages:\nPreparation\n(see\nThe preparation phase\n)\nPlanning\n(see\nThe planning phase\n)\nExecution and Monitoring\n(see\nThe execution and monitoring phase\n)\nWrap-up\n(see\nThe Wrap-up Phase\n)\nThe 4 phases of Agile OKR cycle\nThe preparation phase\nShareholders define the midterm strategy of the company and their linked OKRs (objective + key results) at a company level (\nCompany OKRs\n).\nIn some cases, they can also define the\nDepartment’s OKRs\n, although this is not the recommended approach.\nThe planning phase\nAfter the preparation phase, shareholders communicate company and department (if any) OKRs to the whole company explaining the reasoning behind them.\nAfterward, the Lead Links create their proposals for their Circle's OKR. In this phase, they can use the \"OKR\" teams channel to get in touch with shareholders or the OKR Champion to get clarifications or support when needed.\nWhen they are ready, the Lead Links can submit the proposed OKRs using Holaspirit and get ready to present them to the shareholders.\nA proposal for an OKR should contain:\nAn ambitious yet achievable objective\nA link to a parent OKR\nA rationale explaining why the OKR contributes to the parent OKR\nA few key results to measure (1 to 5)\nExample of an OKR proposal. The OKR is submitted using Holaspirit.\nShareholders review all the proposed OKRs. This review process may involve discussions, clarifications, and negotiations.\nThe goal is ensuring that the selected key results are feasible and relevant. Shareholders inform the Lead Link whether their proposals were not accepted.\nCircles then allocate their budget to support projects according to the objective they plan to achieve.\nCircles define projects in Holaspirit. A project should contain:\nA title\nA label in the format\nOKR<period>\n(eg.\nOKR2024H1\nor\nOKR2024Q3\n)\nAn attached OKR\nAn owner who is accountable for the project\nExample of an OKR project. The project is attached to one or more OKRs and specifies the period as a label.\nThe execution and monitoring phase\nThe progress of an OKR is monitored during the Circles’ tactical meetings. This guarantees that Circles can work on top priorities and can get back on track whenever the current projects are not producing the intended outcomes.\nTo better integrate OKR monitoring into the Circle’s life, a new step has been added to tactical meetings.\nThis is how the OKR step is visualized in a tactical meeting.\nIf the upper-level monitoring reveals issues during the meeting, Lead Links will be in charge of discussing the problems with the circle members.\nEffective Execution\nOKRs check-in happens in tactical meetings. These are vigorous conversations where OKR owners both explain the updates to be tracked and highlight roadblocks. That will keep everyone focused on the top priority tasks.\nDuring these meetings, each OKR owner provides an update about:\nProgress\n: the percentage of OKR completion.\nConfidence\nlevel: to be labelled as \"Healthy\", \"Needs attention\", or \"Unhealthy\". The owner can talk about roadblocks or issues they are encountering.\nPriorities\n: the list of priorities they will be focused on in the following weeks to meet the objective. The goal is to inform people about the main issues that they should be aware of. OKR owners should always keep in mind the motto\n“Don’t just make stuff. Have an impact.”\n, and if they realize that projects underlying OKRs are not effective they must find better initiatives to reach their KR.\nThe Wrap-up Phase\nThe last phase aims to review the result of the OKR cycle, determine if objectives have been achieved, and recognize what went well and what didn't.\nReview and Retrospective\nAt the end of each OKR cycle, the review meeting helps us to understand if we reached our ambitious objective. Usually, a progress > 70% declares a success.\nDuring the retrospective, the team is involved in a blameless analysis of what can be improved in the process and many takeaways become lessons learned.\nJohn Dewey once said, “We don’t learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on experience”.\nAt the end of the cycle, results are communicated to the whole company.\nOKR\nProgress\nScore\nSelf-assessment\nBring in ten new customers.\n70%\n0.9\nDue to a slump in the market, the OKR was significantly tougher to achieve than I’d thought. Our seven new customers represented an exceptionally good effort and outcome.\nBring in ten new customers.\n100%\n0.7\nWhen I reached the objective only eight weeks into the cycle, I realized I’d set the OKR too low.\nBring in ten new customers.\n80%\n0.6\nWhile I signed eight new customers, it was more luck than hard work. One customer brought in five others behind her.\nBring in ten new customers.\n90%\n0.5\nThough I managed to land nine new customers, I discovered that seven would bring in little revenue.\nColumns meaning:\nOKR\n: the name of the OKR\nProgress\n: the objective value that state the percentage of completion of an OKR. If the progress is >= 70%, we succeeded in the work. Otherwise, we failed it.\nSelf-assessment score\n: the self-evaluation score that the OKR owner gives to himself/herself and to his/her team. It is a subjective score that can summarize several aspects: the team's commitment along the cycle, how significant that team's result was to achieve the goal, etc. During the discussion in the retrospective session, this value can be confirmed or changed.\nSelf-assessment comment\n: verbose explanation of the\nSelf-assessment score\ncolumn. \"Why did we give a score of 0.9 despite the OKR failed?\", \"Why did we give a score of 0.5 despite the OKR succeeded?\", \"Was our result really relevant for the objective?\", \"Was the team's engagement consistent and well planned throughout the cycle?\"\nThese are some of the topics we want to clarify here.\nIf the OKR is achieved or not is still stated only from the\nprogress\ncolumn.\nKeep in mind the only purpose of the table is to add contextual information to the final review. A\n60% okr\ncan bring more value to the company compared to a\n90% okr\njust because the second result was set too low at the beginning of the cycle. This value brought to the company should be explicit. In this case, you'll have\nOKR\nProgress\nScore\nSelf-assessment\n\"60% okr name\"\n60%\n0.9\nThe OKR was not reached but the team worked very well despite external blockers\n\"90% okr name\"\n90%\n0.5\nThe team didn't work as a real team since the objective was too easy to reach. Spare activities all in the last two weeks of the okr allow us to reach the objective without issues\nHow to track hours spent on OKRs\nOKR is a tool that helps employees to:\nfind out what are the most important results to achieve strategic company goals\nachieve these goals in an efficient way\nTo achieve results, each department/Circle must undertake one or more project defined in the OKR cycle, but from a financial point of view these projects are linked to the department/Circle.\nFor this reason:\nhours spent in OKR meetings (kick-offs, OKR weeks brainstormings, status update) must be tracked in the \"YYYY Agile - GCC - OKR\" issue\nhours spent by a department in OKR-related initiatives must be tracked in a proper department-specific issue\nResources\nLMS course \"OKR 101\"\nwhatmatters website\nokrexamples website\nCredits\nMeasure what matters [John Doerr]\nRadical Focus [Christina Wodtke]\nOKR Performance [Francesco Frugiuele, Matteo Sola]\nhttps://www.whatmatters.com/"

    "text": "Overall\nWorking at Agile Lab is cooperating with the most talented people you've ever worked with, being the most productive you'll ever be, and creating software that is helping customers to face big challenges.\nDo what is right for our customers and the rest of Agile Lab, do what is best over the long term, don't be evil.\nWe create\nsimple\nsolutions to accomplish complex tasks.\nAlso see our handbook usage and leadership guidelines.\nWe want to have a great company so if you meet people that are\nbetter\nthan yourself try to recruit them to join the company\nBehavior and language\nDo not make jokes or unfriendly remarks about race, ethnic origin, skin color, gender, or sexual orientation.\nUse inclusive language\nShare problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and speak up.\nDon't display surprise when people say they don't know something, as it is important that everyone feels comfortable saying \"I don't know\" and \"I don't understand.\"\nYou can always refuse to deal with people who treat you badly and get out of situations that make you feel uncomfortable.\nEveryone can remind anyone in the company about these guidelines. If there is a disagreement about the interpretations, the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions.\nIf you are unhappy with anything (your duties, your colleague, your boss, your salary, your location, your computer) please let your manager, or the COO or the CEO, know as soon as you realize it. We want to solve problems while they are small.\nMake a conscious effort to\nrecognize\nthe constraints of others within the team. For example, sales is hard because you are dependent on another organization, and Development is hard because you have to preserve the ability to quickly improve the product in the future\nDon't be a one-man show and give the right merits to others\nNot Public\nOperations in Agile Lab are\nnot\npublic, then don't share details in a public way. Some examples:\nFinancial information is confidential.\nDeals with external parties like contracts and approving and paying invoices.\nContent that would violate confidentiality for our customers.\nLegal discussions are not public due to the purpose of Attorney-Client Privilege.\nIndividual job applications, compensation, and feedback are not public since it can contain negative feedback and negative feedback is 1-1 between you and your manager.\nPartnerships with other companies are not public since the partners are frequently not comfortable with that.\nCustomer information in issues are forbidden\nCustomer information is not public\nPlans for reorganizations are not public and on a need-to-know basis within the organization. Reorganizations cause disruption and the plans tend to change a lot before being finalized, so being public about them prolongs the disruption. We will keep relevant team-members informed whenever possible"

    "text": "Handbook\nThis is the central repository about how we run the company and where all the processes are described. If you don't find something, open an issue on the handbook repository.\nHolaspirit\nHolaspirit is the company self-management tool. This is the official repository of roles, circles, accountabilies.\nOffice365\nAgile Lab has the full suite Office365 and it is leveraging the following features:\nMail\nTeams\nCalendar\nSharePoint\nOneDrive\nOneNote\nOffice Suite: Excel - Power Point - Word\nDocument templates\nPowerPoint and Word templates are available at\nBig Data > Documents > Doc templates\nfor sharing content and presentations with customers and external collaborators.\nSharePoint\nSharepoint is the\nofficial\nrepository for documentation. Each team has one Sharepoint site where we store all kind of informations ( requirements, notes, documentation ) related to the customer/project. Everything is immediately shared with the team and available online, so it can be linked to gitlab or in other media.\nCustomer and external people will not access it, if you want to share something with the external world you have to share single files through OneDrive and protecting them with one to one sharing mode.\nIt is an individual responsibility to feed Sharepoint with as much information as possible, organizing documents in a searchable and understandable way.\nSharepoint sites can be automatically synchronized with your local PC, so you can work on your local file system and having background synchronization.\nAlso, we have the \"BigData\" Sharepoint that is available to all the people in AgileLab where you can find training material and interesting technical documents about a lot of technologies.\nVideo Library\nIn Agile we try to write down everything, but video recording can save lot of time and lead to better results to generate a usable and wide knowledge base. Then all the people are encouraged to record videos and upload them to our official video library: Stream ( part of Office 365 ).\nIn Stream you can find the following channels:\nProducts Demo\nR&D\nSoftware Development\nBig Data\nYou can create more. \nThen everytime we have internal workshops we record them with Teams and it automatically uploads on Stream.\nWhen you finish a project milestone or you add a new product feature and a demo is possible, please record a video and share it with the company. \nOne of the most requested feature in Agile Lab is a better knowledge sharing about products and projects, so please help with this and be part of the process.\nRemember\nthat if you ask for knowledge share but you don't start to share about\nyour project\n, it will never work.\nGenerating video contents about products has also a direct benefit towards marketing and sales departments, because they can better understand product features and selling points.\nTeams\nMicrosoft Teams is the preferred way to communicate within the team, but if you want to be sure someone will take an\n action you have to write an email or open an issue on GitLab.\nEach AgileLab member receives an Office365 account during the onboarding phase which will grant access to Teams.\nIt is strongly encouraged to use personal pictures/portraits as Teams avatars and to turn on your webcam during calls\nin order to improve empathy and social relationships with colleagues.\nDo Not Disturb Hours\nTeams mobile app supports \"Quiet Time\" so you won't be pinged in the middle of the night or while you are dealing with family matters. You can set your \"Quiet Time\" by clicking on Notifications and then Hours without notifications. You also have the option of disable notifications on your mobile app if Teams is already active on your desktop. See Teams documentation for more information.\nQuick Search\nTeams provides some shortcuts that allows you to switch between channels and direct messages quickly. Invoke it with Cmd + E on Mac or Ctrl + E on Windows or Linux and start typing the name of the person to chat with or the channel you are interested in. You can then navigate the suggestions with ↑ and ↓ keys and hit enter to select. To navigate only channels use Cmd + G on Mac or Ctrl + G on Windows.\nHide conversations with no unread activity\nWith lots of channels and direct messages, Teams can become overwhelming. To help keep track of activity on Teams, and to simplify the interface, consider hiding conversations with no unread activity.\nBrowse Teams Channels\nBigData\nGenerale\n: greetings, general conversation, no tech stuff\nrandom\n: same as general but more oriented to off topic discussions\ntech\n: link posting and relative discussions about technical topics\nthanks\n: if someone or a team helped you, say thanks in public\nhandbook\n: questions and clarifications about handbook. New merge requests to the handbook will be posted always\non this channel.\nelapseit\n: questions and discussion about timesheets.\nconferences\n: questions and discussion about conferences. It should be the place where we ask other colleagues\nif they want to join us in going to a certain conference.\nlibrary\n: questions and discussion about our internal technical library, ask here if you need to borrow books or\nto request new books\nDev\nGenerale\n: questions and discussion about software development\nElapseit\nElapseit is the project tracking software that we use for:\nResources Allocation\nTimesheets\nBudget Tracking\nHolidays request/approval\nTimesheets must be compiled once a week ( possibly on friday ), in case you are in trouble with that, just drop a question to the dedicated Teams channel\nBigData/elapseit\n.\nElapseit\nSkill Matrix\nA skills matrix is a grid used to map employees' skills and interests towards specific technologies.\nIn Agile Lab we use a Skill Matrix because it helps to drive performance in multiple ways for the team, the individual and the entire organization:\nthe team gains a quick overview of both the skills that are present and the ones that are missing\nthe employees have insights about their own competencies and what they are missing. This is an excellent starting point for learning and development trainings.\nthe organization gets an overview of available competencies and it can identify the best candidate for a project or a certification exam\nThe lastest version of the skill matrix can be found inside the \"Big Data\" SharePoint at the path\nSkillMatrix/skill_matrix_<yyyy>\nThe Certification Coach is in charge to keep it updated asking for periodic updates.\nOther\nKrisp\nKrisp will mute background noise when you're in a noisy environment so you can hear and be heard more easily on calls.\nGrammarly\nGrammarly is a good tool for those who want to feel more comfortable drafting written communication in English (American or British). There is a free and premium version.\nWarning: Grammarly browser extensions are discouraged, Grammarly will have access to everything you type in your browser, and they have had a security problem. If you want to use it to check non-confidential text manually, you should download the desktop version instead.\nBrain.fm\nBrain.fm (free trial) provides music specially designed to help you focus, relax, meditate, recharge, sleep (great for plane rides). It's not just music though. They use scientifically validated brainwave manipulations to get results. It is AMAZING and really does work. Make sure to use with headphones, and give it 10-15 minutes for your brain to get used to it. ($6.95/$15.99/$47.40 per month/quarter/year)\nDo NOT Use\nFlash: Due to security flaws, we strongly recommend not using Adobe Flash. Certainly do not install it on your local machine. But even the Google Chrome plugin that let's you see embedded Flash content in websites can pose a security hazard. If you have not already, go to your Chrome Flash Settings and disable Flash. For further context, note that Google Chrome is removing Flash support soon, and while the plugin is better than a local install of Flash, it still leaves vulnerabilities for zero-day attacks."

This document serves as a reference guide to understanding the insurance plan, enrollment procedures, and key considerations.\n1. Enrollment and Coverage\nWho is covered?\nAll employees EMP1 of Agile Lab with a permanent contract are eligible for PreviGen coverage. The employee's enrollment in the fund is fully covered by Agile Lab.\nEnrollment\nEmployees receive the PreviGen enrollment form along with other onboarding documents. The form must be duly completed (we recommend using a personal email address), signed, and returned to People Administration. Without the completed and signed form, registration for PreviGen cannot be processed.\nOnce the completed form is received, enrollment takes effect in the quarter following the successful completion of the probation period.\nPreviGen Quarters:\nQ1: February - March - April\nQ2: May - June - July\nQ3: August - September - October\nQ4: November - December - January\nFamily Coverage Option\nEmployees can choose to extend coverage to their Family Members.\nEligible family members include:\nSpouse or legally recognized partner, that is, listed in the family status certificate of the employee who is the policyholder of the insurance\nChildren up to\n26 years old\n, provided they are still students\nParents and siblings are\nnot\nincluded in the coverage.\nIn this case, an annual payroll deduction applies.\nFamily members enrolled in PreviGen receive the same coverage and benefits as the employee. However, extending coverage to family members means that policy limits and caps apply to the entire family unit, rather than to each individual separately. These limits can be used by any family member at their discretion.\nFamily members enrollment Timing\nFor existing PreviGen members, family members can only be enrolled at the annual renewal date (January each year)\nFor first-time enrollees, employees can register their family members at the same time as their initial enrollment\nPreviGen enrollments are processed on a quarterly basis and only after the probation period has been completed\nFamily Coverage Costs\nIf an employee extends coverage to their family members, a one-time annual payroll deduction of €500 applies, provided the enrollment occurs within the first two quarters (February or May)\nIf family enrollment occurs from the third quarter onward (starting in August), the payroll deduction will be 70% of the annual fee (€350)\n2. Deadlines & Key Dates\nAnnual Renewal & Enrollment Period\nEach year, a communication will be sent with the specific\ndeadline\nto confirm:\nWhether you wish to enroll your\nfamily members\nin the plan (you must return the completed and signed form)\nWhether you wish to\nopt-out\nof family coverage (if previously enrolled)\nWhether you wish to\nenroll yourself\nif you were not previously included (you must return the completed and signed form)\nAutomatic Renewal\nIf no action is taken, your\nindividual\ncoverage will automatically renew with the same status as the previous year.\n3. Insurance Benefits and Usage\nIncluded Services\nThe insurance covers a wide range of medical services. There is\nno predefined catalog\nof covered procedures; employees should check the\nMyGenerali\nportal or contact the\nPreviGen Help Desk (800.221.133)\nfor information on specific treatments.\nDirect Coverage vs. Reimbursement\nMedical services can be used at\nnetwork providers\n(direct billing) or at\nnon-network providers\n(reimbursement required)\nTwo\ndental services\n(check-ups and tartar removal) are\nonly available through direct billing\nand are not reimbursable\nReimbursement claims require submitting documentation, and a\ndeductible\nor\ncopayment\nmay apply\nDetailed information on policy limits and deductibles is available in the\npolicy conditions\n4. How to Access Healthcare Services\nBooking Appointments\nIt is recommended to wait\nat least 48 hours\nafter the renewal date before scheduling a medical appointment\nBoth\ngeneral practitioner referrals\nand\nprivate specialist prescriptions\nare accepted for booking appointments\nUsing MyGenerali\nOnce enrolled, employees must register on\nMyGenerali\nto manage their insurance benefits\nMedical service requests, approvals, and reimbursement submissions can be handled via the\nMyGenerali portal\nBank Details for Reimbursements\nOnly\none IBAN\ncan be linked to the policyholder’s profile\nIf an employee wishes a reimbursement to be directed to a family member’s bank account, the IBAN must be manually specified during the reimbursement request\n5. Customer Service\nIf you have difficulty identifying the services, you can contact the Operations Center at 800.221.133.\n6. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nCan I see a list of covered medical services?\nNo, PreviGen does not provide a predefined catalog of covered services. You need to check the\nMyGenerali\nportal or contact the\nPreviGen Help Desk\nfor specific service details.\nWhat happens if I visit a non-network provider?\nYou will need to pay for the service upfront and then request reimbursement. However, certain dental services (\ncheck-ups and tartar removal\n) are only available through direct billing and cannot be reimbursed.\nDo family members get the same coverage as employees?\nYes, but if you extend coverage to family members, the policy limits and benefits apply to the\nentire family unit\nrather than to each person individually.\nWhen does my insurance coverage start?\nFor new employees, coverage begins the\nquarter after the probation period is completed\n. Enrollment happens on a quarterly basis as follows:\nFebruary – April\nMay – July\nAugust – October\nNovember – January\nWhen should I schedule a medical appointment after renewal?\nIt is advisable to wait\nat least 48 hours\nafter the renewal date before booking an appointment to ensure the system recognizes your updated coverage.\nCan I change my bank account for reimbursements?\nOnly\none IBAN\ncan be stored for the policyholder. If you need to direct a reimbursement to a\nfamily member’s account\n, you must manually specify their IBAN at the time of request.\nWhat happens if I leave Agile Lab?\nYour coverage remains active until the\nend of the policy period\nin which you leave."

    "text": "Remote working\nIn Agile Lab we make an effort to put people first. When in their best mental and physical conditions, our employees are happier and we believe that a good work-life balance is vital for this to be achieved.\nWe, therefore, encourage the nurturing of social relationships and the sharing of cultural values and we believe that our offices are great places to enable these valuable exchanges. It also offers great opportunities to introduce new people to the company's culture - remember that our junior colleagues can learn from senior ones to build attitudes and behaviors that can be helpful both in and out of office.\nThis produces value for the people, and people produce value for the company.\nIn this way, in Agile Lab, despite all the contracts being full-remote, all offices remain open and available for whomever chooses to work from the office rather than working from home. The choice is completely up to you. There's no need to give a heads-up if one day you want to stay at home or you want to meet other colleagues at the office - Just sign the day on Elpaseit as \"OP - Office presence\".\nHappy people means happy company, and the results is what matters to us (as usual).\nDo you want to know where our offices are located? Check\nOffices\n.\nFlexibile working hours\nNo badge, no hour count: Our working hours are flexible, and people are strongly encouraged to balance work and personal life priorities. Each employee needs to understand when to engage more in work and when it is possible to regain space in private life. We want people to be free to organize their activities as best they can without any constraints but always acting responsibly.\nWe do not use any activity tracking software installed on personal workstations, it is a matter of individual responsibility and professionalism to comply with contractual commitments and correctly report the actual amount of worked hours; in other words, flexibility and goal oriented shall not be intended as \"work as many hours as you want\". The employee shall confirm the daily work and the trip expenses made for the company on the Elapseit platform: no expenses form is requested to the employee, just proof of purchases.\nExtra hours\nIn Agile Lab we don't want to incentivize to work overtime because in the long period can lead to burnout, and we care about our people.\nIf you want to focus more on the job to hit a goal, let's say an intensive week, we strongly recommended to slow down and recover during the following days. You don't need to notify anybody. If you have some credit, you can spend them whenever you want, but, on average, the balance must be neutral.\nAnyway, you can face challenging situations where it is difficult to keep such balance. In that case, you have to notify your manager immediately and start to put those hours in the timesheet labeled as \"SA-Straordinari ad accumulo\" (moreover, extra prizes shall be paid when a group of employees is requested for extra working effort in a specific delivery or project).\nThe extra hours during the night or the weekend shall be paid as stated by the CCNL and the vailability service shall be paid as agreed by the extra-timetable service gross values.\nHowever, in any case, any overtime hours to be paid must be approved in advance by the Team Lead.\nOvertime must be calculated on a multi-period basis (which in our case is on a weekly basis). The multi-period may vary according to company specifications. \nYour manager will review them periodically and will try to find a way to reduce the load and give back those hours. At the end of the semester, anyway exceeding hours will be paid.\nThis mechanism is to incentivizes people not to work overtime."

    "text": "Agile Nomads\nBackground\nAgile Lab is a fully-remote company but has always kept initiatives for fostering connections among its Agilers because\nWe strongly believe that great coworkers make great impact\n.\nAgile Nomads fully represents this company's spirit. \nImagine a unique opportunity to break free from the conventional office setting and join forces with other Agilers in an exclusive location for an unforgettable period of collaboration, growth, and shared experiences.\nWhat is Agile Nomads?\nAgile Nomads is an initiative which enable Agilers to come together, live together, and work together in a curated environment. It's an immersive journey that goes beyond traditional office boundaries, promoting not only professional collaboration but also personal connections and moments of relaxation and joy.\nEvery year, all Agile Nomads participants form groups and travel to a location, hosted by a local facility that enables them to work, explore, and share experiences together, away from home. The groups are designed to mix the diverse experiences of Agilers as much as possible, blending different teams and seniorities.\nAgile Nomads Purpose\nThe primary objective of the Agile Nomads initiative is to create a unique and immersive environment where Agilers can come together, breaking away from traditional office settings, to foster not only professional collaboration but also to build personal connections.\nThis program aims to facilitate shared experiences, learning, and growth, reinforcing Agile Lab's belief that great coworkers make a great impact.\nBy bringing diverse teams and seniorities together in an exclusive location, Agile Nomads seeks to enhance teamwork, creativity, and overall well-being among its participants.\nIt's important that all participants realize that, to make the experience great, is a matter of a collective effort.\nTry to break out of your comfort zone and share your knowledge or get help on hard and soft skill development while you are there!\nHow to participate\nEvery Agiler with a EMP1, EMP2, EMP3 type of contract will receive an email with all the instructions if you wish to join this initiative. \nHowever here is an overall structure on what you can expect:\nWe unveil the destination for the next Agile Nomads edition!\nIn the same email, you will receive a survey which asks your preferred period to travel, with some other preferences questions. You need to compile it to be able to participate!\nWe divide all the participants into groups and publish them as a draft. During this time you can ask for adjustment by talking to the Agile Nomads Coordinators\nGroups get confirmed. It's time to buy the travel tickets!\nEnjoy your stay\nAfter the experience ends, we will ask some general feedback to you. This is extremely important for improving this initiative!\nVacation Policy during Agile Nomads\nBefore requesting vacation during your Agile Nomads stay, please consider the following:\nWill my absence cause issues or tension with the client and/or my team?\nHas the project lead been informed well in advance and approved my vacation?\nCan the group (or at least 50% of the participants) organize a shared activity while on vacation?\nIf all these conditions are met, vacation requests should still respect the following soft limits:\nFor 3-week periods: a maximum of 2 total days (weekly limit set to 8 hours).\nFor 2-week periods: a maximum of 1.5 total days (weekly limit set to 8 hours).\nImportant\n: If public holidays fall within the same week, no additional vacation days can be taken.\nAgile Nomads - FAQ\n1. What costs are covered by Agile Lab?\nAgile Lab covers housing costs for the designated period, coworking, and insurance costs. Travel expenses to reach and come back from the destination are up to the employee, as well as any extra nights, meals and activities. Usually, breakfast is also covered by Agile Lab.\n2. How long does Agile Nomads last?\nThe duration of the initiative may vary from year to year but, as a base, from 2 to 3 weeks, at the choice of the participant. The possibility of staying more or less than 2 to 3 weeks will be communicated along with the proposed destination.\n3. Can I go for just one week?\nIn addition to the choice of destination, the mode of participation can also vary from year to year. Offering a choice of whether to participate in the traditional experience abroad or in a \"lighter\" version of Agile Nomads (such as, for example, a week in Italy) is a theme that emerges each year during the organization of the initiative. If it is possible, along with the proposal abroad, an alternative proposal in Italy in which to stay for only one week will also be published.\n4. In what type of structure does the Agile Nomads take place?\nThe Agile Nomads Coordinators each year strive to research the best structure that can accommodate us. The criteria for choosing are: overall quality of the rooms, large and comfortable space to work in, possibility of having single rooms, and facilities in the area.\n5. I have a need for a single (or double) room. Can I mention this to the organizers?\nWe generally look for facilities that can offer a single room to everyone. In cases where the facility provides both single and double rooms, there will be a question on the form asking for everyone's availability regarding preferences of this type.\n6. I have an allergy, should I mention it?\nYes. In the course of organizing the Agile Nomads, you will be asked to indicate special needs such as allergies and/or intolerances. This information will then be turned over to the breakfast provider (if included in the proposal).\n7. Can I seek other accommodation for myself (and possibly my family)? Who would bear the expense?\nNo, it is not possible. The main goal of Agile Nomads is to build or strengthen bonds among colleagues, and we believe that this goal can be achieved not only by sharing a work space, but also by fully experiencing moments outside working hours.\n8. There is a significantly cheaper flight on a date close to the designated date. Do I have to necessarily travel on the designated days?\nLeaving aside exceptional and emergency situations, it is highly inadvisable to change the departure/return date from that agreed upon. In the case of an extremely higher price or highly inconvenient schedule on the designated day, in the event that traveling a day earlier or a day later is more convenient and/or cheaper, a deviation from the rule is permitted, however trying to avoid interfering with the group's plans.\nAny extra nights required in order to book a more advantageous flight are the responsibility of the employee.\n9. Will food vouchers still be issued during the Agile Nomads period?\nYes, food vouchers will be issued as usual.\n10. By what criteria are the groups formed?\nThe definition of the groups is an accountability of the Agile Nomads Coordinators, who use the availability communicated by each aspiring participant as the first and fundamental criterion for dividing them into groups. To then ensure the most balanced and effective lineup, other factors such as experience of members and composition of groups from previous years are taken into account to the extent possible.\n11. Can I notify the organizers of one or more people I would like to spend Agile Nomads with?\nNormally, organizers do not accommodate specific requests regarding who you would like to spend Agile Nomads with, unless there are exceptional circumstances. One of the main goals of the initiative is to foster new connections among Agilers.\n12. Once the groups are published, is it possible to switch from one group to another?\nSince the groups are formed with several factors in mind, transfer to another group is accepted only as a result of the occurred inability to leave with the designated group. Should this need arise, it will need to be discussed with the Agile Nomads Coordinators who will try to find a solution.\n13. I made a mistake in indicating the preferred weeks. How can I fix this?\nContact one of the Agile Nomads Coordinators immediately and inform them of the misunderstanding. If the groups have not yet been published on the official Agile Nomads channel, there is a good chance that the problem can be resolved. On the other hand, in the case where groups have already been defined and published, the possibility of changing groups is not guaranteed.\n14. I have decided to drop Agile Nomads despite already being assigned to a group. Is it okay?\nUnforeseen events happen, and of course this can never be a problem. It should be considered, however, that once the final memberships are collected, Agile Lab incurs a significant expense for each individual participant. Most likely, this expense is settled before the initiative begins and therefore giving up Agile Nomads when it is too late means wasting budget. The rule is always the same: \"spend company's money like it's your own.\""

We understand that important life events, such as marriage, becoming a parent, or caring for family members, can strongly affect a person’s well-being and performance at work.\nSupporting working parents is a key part of our approach. Instead of offering direct financial help, Agile Lab provides personalized support to employees returning from parental leave. This flexible approach includes options like gradual return to work, flexible hours, and access to workshops or coaching sessions focused on managing work-life balance.\nWe also value other meaningful family moments, such as marriage, and aim to make our company policies empathetic and adaptable.

Professional growth means to improve both hard (e.g., technical) and soft skills (e.g., company values, leadership), and is not limited to technical roles.\nThis training budget cannot be used to buy tools or subscriptions for personal productivity.\nTraining time and cash is a benefit and each Agiler is accountable to monitor their own personal spend. A tool to facilitate personal training time and budget tracking is available in company's\nsharepoint://BigData/Documents/Self Management/TrainingBudgetTemplate.xlsx\n.\nTime training budget (EMP1, EMP2, EMP3)\nEach Agile Lab EMP1, EMP2 and EMP3 employee has a time training budget that can spend along the year. In the case of full-time employees, the time training budget is a maximum of 12 hours/month. In case of part-time EMP1 employee this monthly training budget is proportionally reduced. This training budget can't be used after resigning and during the notice period.\nIn order to allow the management to correctly forecast budget and people allocation, while at the same time motivating and allowing employees not to waste their time budget if they are full on their projects for a few weeks/months, we have the following time budget accumulation policy: time budget can be accumulated up until a 3 months span (with monthly budget being fully unlocked at the beginning of the month), the time not spent learning in the previous months is unfortunately wasted. Moreover, regardless of the accumulated ammount, the time budget always expires at the end of the year (for accounting reasons).\nFor example, if you don't take any time to learn something new for the first 4 full months of the year (4\n12 = 48 hours), on May 1st you'd \"only\" have left the previous 2 months window worth of time budget (March, April) which adds-up with May's budget making it a total of 3\n12 = 36h spendable in May. Please, remember that even in this case it would mean being off projects for almost 1 whole week, which would complicate things with customers probably, so use your own sensitivity to understand what makes sense or not.\nAll the guidelines to be followed for time tracking on Elapseit are available in\nProject Time Tracking\n(focus on the Training section).\nCash training budget (EMP1, EMP2, EMP3)\nEach Agile Lab EMP1, EMP2 and EMP3 employee from every circle has a cash training budget that can spend along the year. In the case of full-time employees, the cash training budget is a maximum of 1000 €/year. In case of part-time EMP1 employee this monthly training budget is proportionally reduced. This training budget can't be used after resigning and during the notice period.\nThis budget can be spent in one or multiple installments.\nIn the second half of the year (H2, meaning from July to December), no more than half of this budget can be used due to financial planning reasons. Exceptions can be made for big expenses that cannot be planned six months in advance (e.g. conference happening late in Q4 and still no way to buy tickets or cannot commit yet, course released later in the year, ...) by coordinating with the Training circle Lead Link and the Purchasing Officer. Within each calendar year, you can't spend more than your yearly maximum allowance with your cash training budget.\nAny unused budget is forfeited at the end of the year and does not accumulate into subsequent years.\nThe training budget is available also for new hires with the same rules: if hired during H1, the new employee will have 1000 € for the year (with 500 € expiring after June 30th).\nIf hired during H2, the new employee will have 500 €.\nPayment methods with cash training budget (e.g., reimbursement, direct billing to Agile Lab) are defined by the\ncircle:Finance\ncircle. You can find this information in\nSpendingCompanyMoney\npage.\nTraining budget allocation\nBoth the cash and time training budgets can be utilized in various ways.\nIt cannot be used to buy tools or subscriptions for personal productivity.\nBelow is a list of allowed usages:\nCertifications\nIT certifications are a great way to demonstrate our excellence in a specific field, so employees are encouraged to do them as much as possible. You can decide to use the time training budget to gain extra time to study in preparation for a certification. Follow the process described in the\nCertifications\nsection.\nConferences\nConferences are a great resource to feed the technical growth and to stimulate the desire to try new technologies or to implement new solutions. The comparison with what others do is always positive.\nYou can attend one or more international conferences per year. Each conference must be inherent to the spectrum of technologies and interests of Agile Lab.\nAgile Lab will pay for:\nTrasportations\nAccomodation (max 3 nights)\nConference Ticket\nFood (max 2 days)\nAll of them must be less than \"Cash Budget\" + 500 € (for travel expenses)\nThe extra budget for travelling and accomodation of 500 € is to be intended as an extra bonus which doesn't add up to the standard budget. This means that, for example, if you spend 100 € in travel expenses you DON'T have 400 € as extra personal training budget. \nAnother example: let's say the conference ticket costs 1000 € and as travel expenses you spend 100 €: in this case you don't have any other training budget left, since the 1000 € for the conference ticket consumed all of it. There's no \"automatic conversion\" of travel expenses budget to regular training budget, since this would be unfair wrt colleagues who don't attend a conference (thus having \"only\" 1000 € budget).\nThe days spent at the conference are subtracted by the time training budget.\nCheck\nConferences\nto see how to attend a conference.\nTraining material\nWith the \"Cash Budget\", you can buy courses, books and other materials useful for certifications or your professional path. You can always ask your coach to help identifying some options.\nYou can use you training budget for subscriptions to learning platforms that are aligned with your professional trajectory and with company needs. When you activate a subscription to a trainign platform, make sure that the automatic renewal of the purchased service is not activated.\nLearning\nThe time training budget is also useful to attend internal workshops or online courses on our\ninternal LMS\n. It is also allowed to spend your time training budget to read books, follow bought courses, etc.\nOutsourced Technical Trainings\nAnother alternative are outsourced trainings, they are good compromises for those who are looking for a more effective (learn-by-doing) approach, but with tool boxes mostly full of I-shaped contents.\nSuch training must be inherent to the spectrum of technologies and interests of Agile Lab or related on foundational technical approaches at least.\nLimitations are the same applied for conferences.\nOutsource Trainings\nfor details.\nFor guidelines about how to make/request purchases or reimbursements, please consult\nSpending Company Money\n.\nBrag file\nIt is also allowed to spend the time training budget can also be used to write the\nbrag file\n. The brag file, in fact, is an active part of individual growth, and taking the right amount of time to work on it allows for a better understanding of one's strengths and weaknesses, aiming to trigger a process of continuous improvement.\nOpen Source Contributing\nIn Agile Lab we want to let people express their potential contributing to world class open source projects.

These days are allocated for everyone, no exceptions, the company is officially \"closed\". Every year People will decide how many days to allocate for everyone based on how good we have been in consuming holidays the previous year.\nThe two central weeks of August\nTwo weeks between December and January\nAdditionally, if the amount of days of the default allocation exceeds the vacation days accumulable during the year, employees are not forced to take extra vacation but they can ask for (see\nApproval\n).\nPlanning and Approval\nPeople requires the full vacation planning to be done in the first half of the year. Vacations can be moved later if necessary, but they must be planned. All vacations and leave requests must be agreed with the BU Lead/Lead Link, entered in Elapseit and shared with People Circle. To allow proper tracking, all planned vacation must be entered in Elapseit, otherwise it cannot be considered approved.\nPlease note:\nif the planning is not submitted by the end of June, the company will assign mandatory closure days ( according with defaut allocation: two weeks in August and December/January ) only to those who have not planned, to ensure full use of the accrued time\nLeader duties\nLeaders generate awareness. A leader is accountable for ensuring that people are fine or not with the default holiday. She/he periodically (with a period up to the leader) reminds employees to allocate holidays.\nA leader has the responsibility to negotiate vacation periods across all the team members to guarantee a fair distribution of days off (if possible).\nShe/he has also the responsibility to inform the customer about vacation periods and plan for them.\nLeaders talk to one another when people move across different circles/projects to make sure about their availability.\nEmployee duties\nEmployees should always plan for vacation and double-check with their manager how to handle the vacation period.\nWe trust our employees and we expect everyone to collaborate to help the manager to fit everyone's needs with the planned schedule.\nCollaboration means making sure that, for instance, not all project members take a vacation at the same time in the middle of a delivery.\nEvery employee should have visibility about all the others in order to agree on a plan.\nMandatory company closures\nAgile Lab may schedule mandatory company closures during the year.\nIn some project contexts or with specific clients, it may be necessary to ensure operational coverage even on company closure days.\nIn these cases, responsibility lies with the relevant lead, who is required to:\ninform People Admin circle with adequate advance notice, specifying by name who needs to work on that day;\nensure that the worked day is recovered within the same month.\nIn the absence of a prior agreement with People Admin circle, the day will be managed as a company closure.\nSaint Patron's feast days\nThe employee is required to use the feast of the Patron Saint of the place where he/she is currently hired. Below is the list of Patron Saints by location:\nBologna: October 4th\nCatania: February 5th\nMilano:  December 7th\nPadova:  June 13th\nRende:   February 20th\nTorino:  June 24th\nThe employee should not insert hours in the Timesheet or Leave because the payroll program knows that the people on site are on holiday on that day.\nExceptionally, it is possible to use the Patron Saint of one's place of residence, replacing it with that of the place of employment, giving ample notice to peopleadmin@agilelab.it to properly manage the payroll. Only in this case is it necessary to use the Leave Type\nSP - Santo Patrono\n, because the Feast Day is not on the list.\nBlood Donation\nEmployees are entitled to take 1 day off on the day of blood donation. It is mandatory to send the donation certificate to peopleadmin@agilelab.it.\nTo log the absence in\nElapseit\n, select the leave type\nDS-Donazione_sangue\n.\nSick Leave Certificate\nIn case of illness, employees must submit a medical certificate starting from the first day of absence by:\nSending the certificate via email to peopleadmin@agilelab.it, or\nWriting the protocol number in the leave request notes in Elapseit\nMake sure that the date of the medical certificate matches the date of the starting of the illness.\nThe absence must be recorded in\nElapseit\nby selecting the leave type\nM1-Malattia\nor\nSick Leave\n."

    "text": "HW Purchase & Replacement\nHardware, goods and services for the office\nThe purchase of goods and services necessary to make our physical offices comfortable for everyone is the responsibility of\nPeople Care/Facility\n. \nIf you often spend time in one of our offices and need to purchase something to work with in the office, always ask the\nPeople Care/Facility\n.”\nThe Welcome Pack\nInstead, everything you need to work remotely is included in the Welcome Pack, which is managed by\nPeople Care/Welcome Pack & HW Replacement\n, and it will be provided to you at the time of hiring.\nThe complete Welcome Pack includes a laptop and the following accessories: monitor, USB hub, headphones, keyboard, and mouse.\nThe budget for the Welcome Pack is equal to the total cost of the articles listed in the catalog (one article per category), according to the latest version of the catalog that is sent during onboarding and/or in case of a request to\nPeople Care/Welcome Pack & HW Replacement\nfor necessary replacement.\nAccessories can be changed with other similar articles in the same price range, upon approval by\nPeople Care/Welcome Pack & HW Replacement\n.\nThe request of similar article must be within the perimeter of the Welcome Pack (e.g. if you need a particular keyboard, you can ask for a keyboard with a budget around the budget defined for the keyboard in the Welcome Pack; otherwise, if you want an office chair for working from home, which is a component not included in the Welcome Pack, you cannot request it).\nIf, during on-boarding, one or more articles are not needed by the employee, these are not ordered. In this case, the employee may choose to reallocate the budget of the unneeded articles to the chosen ones or order them later if necessary.\nAfter the Welcome Pack articles are ordered, as soon as they are available, the tracking number is sent to track the shipment.\nOnce the Welcome Pack has been received, each component must be registered in the Census file.\nEach employee is required to complete the following form:\nhttps://forms.office.com/e/Bt59qfYdgR\nReplacements or additional hardware requests\nIf you need to purchase something that you did not initially request and is included in the Welcome Pack catalogue, you can refer to\nPeople Care/ Welcome Pack & HW Replacement\n.\nIt will be checked whether indeed this component was not requested at the on-boarding phase and whether the employee still has budget available. If so, the order will be placed.\nYou can also refer to\nPeople Care/ Welcome Pack & HW Replacement\nif you need to replace a Welcome Pack component because it is malfunctioning or broken.\nA request for replacement of the laptop can only be made after 3 years of using it and if substantial problems are found in its use. The employee may request a replacement from\nPeople Care/ Welcome Pack & HW Replacement\n. It will be checked in the census file whether 3 years have actually passed since the purchase. The new laptop model and specifications are decided by internal IT and updated frequently.\nEach time the employee replaces his or her laptop or any other HW, he or she must fill in the census form again:\nhttps://forms.office.com/e/Bt59qfYdgR\nWhen an employee requests a laptop replacement, he or she may also ask to purchase his or her previous laptop for personal use.\nThis laptop buy-back process is regulated by the following rules, which apply only to the laptop assigned to each employee by the company:\nThe quotation for the used laptop will be provided by the supplier who usually supports Agile Lab in resetting and restoring the PCs that are returned by employees at the time of off-boarding. \nIn this case, without physically handing back the laptop, this quotation will be made based on the model of the laptop, its technical characteristics, the year of the first purchase and evaluating the market price at the current date, also based on the current condition of the laptop. \nOn this quotation, Agile Lab will apply a dedicated employee discount of 10%.\nThe proposal will then be made to the employee who has expressed a willingness to purchase the laptop. This will be followed by an assessment of possible further discounts to be applied to the first proposed price.\nIf the proposal is accepted, Agile Lab will issue an invoice to the employee, which will be paid by bank transfer.\nWhen the buy-back is approved, the employee must notify @InternaIT that the laptop is no longer owned by the company, so that the GDPR's de-registration policies can be applied.\nCompany Phones and SIM Cards\nTo ensure efficient and responsible management of company resources, Agile Lab provides company phones and SIM cards only to employees whose roles require direct phone engagement, such as Support, Recruiting, or Sales.\nIf you need a company phone or SIM, please download and fill in the\nAGILE LAB_All.1 Company Phone and SIM request form\nand send it via email to your Lead Link and the\nPeople Care/ Welcome Pack & HW Replacement\n. Be sure to include your contact details, BU, the requested device, the purpose of use, and the expected activity timeline.\nRequests are evaluated by your Lead Link for operational necessity and then approved by People Care in line with company policies. Once approved,\nPeople Care/ Welcome Pack & HW Replacement\nwill manage the purchase, shipping, and setup instructions.\nDevices must be used primarily for work activities; personal use should remain minimal. Employees are responsible for their device’s care and must report any issues, loss, or theft to Internal IT immediately. Phone replacements are allowed after 2 years of use if significant issues arise.\nFor more details, refer to the full document\nOperating Guidelines for Requesting Company Phone and SIM\n."

When they are in the best mental and physical condition, our employees are happiest, and we believe that a good work-life balance is key to achieving this.\nTherefore, although all contracts are completely remote, we believe in the value of having physical offices, where we encourage social relationships, sharing of cultural values and professional collaboration.\nThis also offers great opportunities to introduce new people to the corporate culture: remember that our junior colleagues can learn from senior ones to establish attitudes and behaviours that can be useful both inside and outside the office.\nThis produces value for people and people produce value for the company.\nAt Agile Lab, therefore, all offices remain open and available to anyone who chooses to work from the office rather than from home. The choice is completely up to you. There is no need to inform yourself if you want to stay at home one day or want to meet other colleagues in the office: just follow the\noperating guidelines\nfor accessing the offices and mark the day of your presence on Elpaseit with the\nOP - Office Presence\nspecification for the office you are attending.\nOffices Location\nAgile Lab covers six physical locations:\nBologna\nCatania\nMilano\nPadova\nRende\nTorino\nGuidelines for opening and closing an office\nIf the objective of Agile Lab offices is to provide employees with a space for collaboration, socialisation and growth, then an Agile Lab office only makes sense if there are at least a minimum of 5 employees residing in the same territorial area and interested in using the office.\nIn this case, a contact person from this group of employees interested in opening a new office can write to the Lead Link of the People Care circle submitting their proposal, including the city in which they would like to open a new office, the number of people interested, a coworking proposal or rental solutions (if already searched for in the area concerned).\nPeople Care will take charge of the request, evaluate the conditions for opening the new office and the solutions proposed by the employees (and/or look for new solutions), and will evaluate the possibilities and timeframe for opening the new office according to the budget available.\nOtherwise, when the situation arises where an active office is little used and/or there are fewer than 5 employees living in the territorial area where the office is located, People Care and the\nPeople Care/Facility\nmay decide to close the office.\nTo start going to an office\nIf you are interested in or need to start going to an Agile Lab office, the first thing you need to do is to contact the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the office you are interested in. He/she will take care of adding you to the office's Teams channel and mailing list so that you can be informed about the organisation of the office, socialising events organised by colleagues who frequent the same office and all compliance aspects related to the office.\nIn addition, follow the operating guidelines below for requesting access to the office and check the Handbook page of the office of interest to access the guidelines on emergency procedures.\nOperating guidelines for office access control\nThe\nAccess Control Operating Guidelines\naim to prevent unauthorised access that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of resources and/or the smooth running of work activities.\nAgile Lab’s offices can be accessed by:\nEmployees who freely decide to access one of Agile Lab's operating offices on a regular basis.\nEmployees who need or want occasional access to one of Agile Lab's operating offices.\nLong-term external consultants/collaborators and employees of external companies (e.g. maintenance, cleaning, etc.)\nGuests\nMinor\nAuthorities and FF.O\nEmployees and Long-term external consultants access\nIn the case of employees and long-term external consultant, the access control system provides for the issuing of a badge or other control device authorising entry for the period strictly necessary for the performance of their duties at the office.\nEmployee office access request\n:\nEmployees who freely decide to attend one of Agile Lab's offices more or less constantly, identifying their location of interest on the basis of their territorial area of residence, must request access to the office by filling out and signing the form\nAGILE LAB_All.1 Office Access request form for employees\nand sending it via email to the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the location of interest. \nThe\nPeople Care/Facility\nwill activate the control device for the employee and compile the census file. \nEmployees who need access to one of Agile Lab's offices for one day only must instead follow the procedure for Guests.\nExternal consultant office access request\n:\nThe Lead Link of the circle who needs to have consultants or external staff access the Agile Lab offices on an ongoing basis must request access to the office by filling out and signing the form\nAGILE LAB_All.2 Office access request form for external collaborators\nand emailing it to the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the office of interest. \nThe\nPeople Care/Facility\nwill activate the control device for the consultant and compile the census file.\nIn both cases, the control device at the end of the period of collaboration must be returned and disabled. The control device holder should then contact the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the office he/she attended and for which he/she was assigned a control device to organise the return and/or disabling of the control device.\nIn the event of anomalies or malfunctioning of the control device during access, immediate notification to the\nPeople Care/Facility\nby email will suffice, specifying what has occurred. \nIn order to issue a new control device, a new request must be made by the employee, enclosing a copy of the request form.\nIn the event of control device loss or theft, if the control device does not contain any identification and/or company data, immediate notification to the\nPeople Care/Facility\nby email will suffice, specifying the incident. \nIn the case of a control device containing identification and/or company data, it will also be necessary to file a complaint with the competent authorities (Police or Carabinieri).\nIn order to issue a new control device, a new request will have to be made by the employee, attaching a copy of the request form (and of the complaint, where applicable).\nGuest Access\nGuests include employees who need or want occasional access to one of Agile Lab's operating offices as well as consultants, customers, partners that an Agile Lab employee needs to meet at one of Agilelab's operating offices.\nIn this case a control device is not issued.\nEmployee Occasional Access Request\n:\nAn employee who needs or wants occasional access to one of Agile Lab's operating offices must contact the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the office of interest to ensure that someone will be available to welcome him/her at the office.\nThe Facility Manager can either be present in person or delegate one of the other employees who is a regular user of the office to welcome the guest.\nOnce the reference person who will be in charge of welcoming the guest has been identified, the employee who needs occasional access to the office must fill in and sign the form\nAGILE LAB_All.3 Guest registration\nand send it by email to the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the office of interest for appropriate archiving.\nOccasional access request for consultants, clients, partners\n:\nThe employee who needs to meet a consultant, client or partner at one of Agile Lab's offices must request access by filling out and having the guest sign the form\nAGILE LAB_All.3 Guest registration\nand sending it via email to the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the office of interest for appropriate archiving. \nThe employee receiving the visit must give the guest the Guest Card available at the site of interest and the guest must wear this Guest Card for the duration of the visit for appropriate recognition.\nMinor Access\nMinors can access, on an occasional basis, Agile Lab's operational sites only if accompanied by a parent or other adult acting on their behalf (guest or employee), subject to assuming the relevant responsibility, as provided for in the access control procedure of the individual site. The minor's access to the site is subject to the completion and delivery of the attached\nAGILE LAB_All.4 Minor access form\n, to be sent by email to the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the site of interest.\nFF.O. or External Authorities access for inspection visits\nIt is regulated the possible access to Agile Lab's operating sites of different Authorities, such as Supervisory and Control Authorities, FF.O. Staff, AGCOM Inspectors, Government Officials, etc.\nIn all these cases, the People Care Circle Contact Person or the persons who may be present at the site must immediately inform the Compliance Circle and proceed to identify the official by means of a valid personal identity document and identification of the body to which he or she belongs.\nIn the course of the visit/inspection, the maximum cooperation must be provided by facilitating the access activities, taking note of the requests, keeping a copy of any documentation produced and taking care to forward it to the Compliance Circle.\nThe judicial authorities and the F.F.O., as part of their investigative activities, may request access to the images recorded by the video surveillance system, which may be present in the building. In these cases, the person making the identification must acquire the documentation produced by the authorities and direct the request to the Compliance Circle, who will take care of the subsequent steps with the person who manages the maintenance of the installed system.\nAccess with company or private vehicles\nAll the staff may enter Agile Lab's operating sites via the pedestrian accesses. Entry by vehicle into the internal car park of the operational site is only permitted to authorised personnel in compliance with the procedure drawn up by the territorially competent function.\nIn this context, access to the car park inside the operational site is permitted to:\nCompany vehicles: company vehicles may access the internal areas if the driver is authorised to do so by the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the relevant operational site.\nEmployee-owned vehicles: only vehicles authorised in advance for the designated parking areas may access the internal parking areas. It is generally not permitted to leave the vehicle parked overnight, except for service requirements which must be communicated well in advance to the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the operating site of interest.\nVehicles of third party guests: where provided for, access of third party guests' vehicles to the internal car parks is subject to the availability of free spaces at the time of entry. In any case, it is only permitted from the gates designated for this service and subject to authorisation by the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the operating site concerned.\nVehicles/vehicles of external companies carrying out third-party services: the external company, authorised in advance for access, must submit, through the Circle concerned, to the\nPeople Care/Facility\nof the operating site of interest, the documentation envisaged in the access control procedure. It is in any case necessary that the vehicle (model, number plate or, alternatively for work vehicles, registration number, chassis number, etc.) be communicated in advance to the guard station, where present.\nAll non-company vehicles authorised to park inside the company car park are liable for damage caused to parked vehicles regardless of the provisions of their insurance policies, which must in any case be inspected by the personnel in charge on request."

    "section": "People Operations",
    "level": "1.3.13",
    "text": "Certification Guidelines\nAt Agile Lab, we believe in continuous professional growth as the key to technical excellence and individual success. Certifications provide an opportunity to acquire new skills, demonstrate industry expertise, and strengthen the company's market positioning. Investing in personal growth ensures quality for all our stakeholders.\nAt the beginning of each year, the\nAgile Lab/CTO\ndefines the company's technical strategy, identifying key technologies and the skills to develop.\nThe\nConsulting/Certification Coach\ncreates a new\nCertification Plan\nby cloning the previous year's document and updating it based on the technical strategy defined by the CTO, which establishes:\nWhich certifications are a priority for the current year;\nWhich certifications need to be maintained and renewed.\nThis plan is dynamic and can be updated throughout the year to adapt to new business needs or emerging opportunities.\nYou can find the updated plan in the SharePoint under the path\nBigData/Certifications/Certification Plan 202x\n.\nCertification domains\nAll certifications must be related to topics relevant to the roles and requirements outlined in the company's ladder. Here are some example areas:\nData Science;\nData Engineering;\nData Analysis;\nSoftware Engineering;\nLeadership and Management;\nEtc.\nIf you are unsure whether the certification you wish to pursue aligns with the certification domains, you can consult the Certification Coach for further clarification. We are happy to guide you.\nCertification classification\nCertifications are divided into two categories:\nPriority 1 (P1)\n: Certifications included in the Certification Plan. These are considered strategic for the company and receive the highest priority in terms of support and incentives.\nPriority 2 (P2)\n: Certifications not included in the plan or obtained in a higher number than planned. While still supported, they are not considered strategic for the company and therefore have a different level of priority.\nCertification renewals follow the same logic. If the renewal requires a new paid exam, the certification is treated as new and follows the priority rules.\nCertification process\n1. Planning and choosing the certification\nThe first step in obtaining a certification is planning. If you already have a clear idea of the certification you want to achieve, or if you need guidance on which one best fits your career path, the starting point is a\none-to-one meeting with the Certification Coach\n.\nDuring this meeting, you can discuss:\nYour professional goals and the skills you want to develop;\nThe technologies you are working with and their relevance to Agile Lab's strategy;\nThe most suitable path for you, considering the available certification domains.\nIf the desired certification is included in the Certification Plan, you will need to add a row with your full name, setting the status to\nIntention\nand entering an estimated exam date in the appropriate fields of the Certification Plan.\nIf the certification is not in the plan, it will be evaluated by the Certification Coach:\nIf a similar certification is already included in the Certification Plan, priority will be given to that one (you can still pursue the original certification at a later stage);\nIf the certification aligns with the available certification domains, it will be classified as P2 and supported accordingly. This phase is essential to define a clear path and ensure you have the right resources for preparation.\n2. Preparation and time management\nExam preparation is a crucial part of the process. Agile Lab offers support in different ways:\nIf the certification is P1, you are entitled to up to 12 additional working hours (depending on the certification's difficulty) from your time training budget to dedicate to preparation and taking the exam. Refer to the Training section of\nWelfare & Benefits\nfor details regarding the standard training budget, and check the Certification Plan to see how many extra hours you can get for each certification.\nIf the certification is classified as P2, you can still use your standard training budget to purchase courses, books, or attend events (both online and offline). However, no additional working hours are provided.\nTo ensure a balance between study and work activities, your Team Leader will help you:\nOrganize your time effectively;\nMonitor progress and address any challenges;\nIntegrate study with relevant work projects and activities.\nIn addition to the support from the Team Leader and Certification Coach, you will have access to:\nThe\nTraining Portal\n, which contains courses, guides, study materials, and tips relevant to your certification;\nThe SharePoint folder\nBigData/Certifications\n, which includes additional study materials shared by colleagues who have already obtained a certification;\nThe Teams channel\nBigData/Certifications\n, where you can ask for advice and suggestions.\n3. Booking the certification exam\nOnce you have completed your study plan, you will need to proceed with booking your exam. A couple of months before your estimated exam date, contact the Certification Coach to check if any vouchers or discounts are available for your certification exam.\nIf no vouchers are available, you can proceed with self-purchasing the exam and request reimbursement via Elapseit, following the guidelines in\nSpending Company Money\n.\nAfter booking the exam, update the Certification Plan by selecting:\nBooked P1\nif the current number of P1 bookings plus the number of certifications obtained is still below the required amount;\nBooked P2\notherwise.\nIf you wish to book an exam earlier than those already scheduled and gain priority 1, contact your Certification Coach to check if this is possible.\nYou can also verify which bookings are available in the\nPriority Check\nfield at the bottom of the document.\n4. Monitoring and follow-up\nThe certification process is a significant commitment, so it will be monitored regularly through:\nPeriodic check-ins with your Team Leader to assess progress and overcome any obstacles;\nOngoing support from the Certification Coach, who will track your progress and help you optimize your preparation.\nThe Certification Coach performs a weekly review of the Certification Plan to ensure that the company's certification roadmap is up to date and that all candidates have a clear study strategy.\nSpecifically, the Coach:\nChecks whether candidates have updated their status in the plan (e.g., from \"Intention\" to \"Booked\");\nContacts those who have not communicated their study plan to ensure alignment with business objectives;\nIdentifies candidates for unassigned certifications to ensure that strategic skills are covered.\n5. Completing the exam and recording the certification\nAfter taking the exam, you must inform the Certification Coach of the result.\nIf you pass the exam:\nUpdate the Certification Plan by setting the status to\nAchieved\nsend an update to the Certification Coach;\nThe Certification Coach will notify the management and update the official certification registry;\nYour achievement will be announced in the Teams channel\nBig Data/Certifications\n, sharing the milestone with colleagues and promoting a culture of continuous learning;\nIf the certification was classified as P1, you will be eligible for a reward, which will be granted at the end of the year according to the defined rules.\nIf you fail the exam:\nYou can retake the exam, but you must still report the result to the Certification Coach;\nFor P1 certifications, if you pass on the second attempt, the\nreward will be reduced by 50%\n;\nFurther attempts must be agreed upon with the Certification Coach, as funding will not be available for a third attempt, except in exceptional cases.\nTo foster knowledge sharing, always document your exam experience (tips and insights are welcome) in the company's Big Data OneNote, under the dedicated certifications section. If a section for your specific exam already exists, add your experience there.\nThe value and recognition of certification\nCertification impact\nObtaining a certification is an important step in your professional growth, and Agile Lab is with you at every stage of the journey. Follow the process, make the most of the available resources, and remember that each certification is an achievement that belongs to you forever and may have an impact on the company, so you are encouraged to include it in your pitch (see\nEngineering Ladder\n).\nIncentives and rewards\nThe reward for achieving a certification is a tangible recognition of individual effort. However, its true value is not just financial—it lies in professional growth, acquired skills, and the prestige the certification brings to your career.\nSupport and management\nOrganizing study materials\nAll study materials must be saved in SharePoint under\nBigData/Certifications\nand published on the Training Portal, following the standard naming convention to facilitate search and access.\nTo improve and speed up the search for previously purchased or available training material, please use the full name of the certification (e.g., Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals).\nIf you know of existing materials stored in another SharePoint folder, you are strongly encouraged to move them to the specified folder or publish a dedicated page following the Training Portal policies.\nThe following materials are allowed:\nOfficial guides;\nShared notes;\nPractice exercises;\nLinks to courses.\nThe role of the Certification Coach\nThe Certification Coach is the main point of contact for everything related to certifications. Their responsibilities include:\nManaging the onboarding process for new Agilers, verifying if they have relevant prior certifications for Agile Lab;\nMonitoring the Teams channel\nBigData/Certifications\n, providing support and answering questions;\nCreating and managing the Certification Plan, updating it regularly;\nOrganizing one-to-one meetings to help you choose the best certification path;\nTracking candidates' progress, offering support and study resources;\nEnsuring the renewal of company certifications, making sure partnership requirements and internal skill levels are maintained;\nPromoting and recognizing achievements, communicating results to management and across the company.\nIf you have any questions or want to start your certification journey, contact the Certification Coach.\nCertification renewal\nThe Certification Coach will monitor expiring certifications and contact certificate holders to evaluate renewal options.\nIf a certification remains strategic for the company and is part of the Certification Plan, its renewal will be treated as P1. If it is no longer relevant, you can choose to renew it personally as a P2, following the previously described rules.\nManaging certifications when leaving the company\nIf a certified employee leaves Agile Lab, the Certification Coach will:\nRemove their name from the certification registry;\nCheck if the certification covers a strategic requirement and, if necessary, identify a replacement to maintain the company's skill level.\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\nWhat happens if I fail a P1 certification?\nYou can take a second attempt. In this case, the reward will be reduced by 50%, while the exam cost will still be deducted from your training budget. For a third attempt (or further), no rewards or reimbursements will be provided for the certification cost.\nWho supports me in my certification journey?\nYou will plan your study path with the Certification Coach and implement it with the support of your Team Leader, who will be your daily point of reference.\nCan I obtain certifications not included in the Certification Plan?\nAbsolutely! They will be classified as P2, as long as they align with the certification domains. Schedule a meeting with the Certification Coach for more details."

This is staff augmentation, but anyway we always try to build long-term relationships.\nCON2\n: Contractor short-mid term. Freelances or other people belonging to other organizations and working on a specific project.\n[!Warning] Notice that the categories are not directly related with the Engineering Ladder level, i.e. EMP1 is not ENG1.\nThe following table summarizes the differences across these categories and clarifies the corresponding entitlements:\nEMP1\nEMP2\nEMP3\nCON1\nCON2\nLadder\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nBuddy Onboarding\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nCoaching\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nTraining Budget\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nTeam Building\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nCompany Meetings\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nTicket Restaurants\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\n8% bonus\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nReferral Fee*\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nHealth Insurance\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\nWelcome Pack\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nIntune\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nBigData Group\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nLMS\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nAgile Nomads\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nBizAway\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nSocial Events\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\n*The referral fee applies to all categories marked “Yes”, but only if the referred person is deemed suitable for at least level 3 of the ladder and is hired as an EMP1. No fee is granted if the referred profiles are consultants or freelancers.\nAll contracts are to be considered remote. However, it is mandatory to provide the physical address where you will be performing your job duties. All job activities must be carried out in a private location and in accordance with the terms of the contract. If you wish to relocate for a period, this is permissible (for EMP1, relocation is restricted to the GDPR area only), but you are required to notify the administration in advance of your new location and address and obtain approval.\nContract Modifications\nAny necessary modifications to contracts fall under the responsibility and ownership of the People Administration & Hiring Circle. Each adjustment will be carefully evaluated and notified to the relevant teams."

    "text": "Guiding Principles of the Engineering Selection Process\nAt Agile Lab, the recruitment and selection process is not just a series of steps:\nit is a\nstrategic activity\nthat reflects our values and culture.\nThe way we hire people defines who we are as an organization.\nThe pillars of our process are:\n🤝 Collaboration\nLeverage Agile Lab’s global talent networks.\nBuild a\nstructured referral program\nto encourage employees to recommend new talent.\nPromote cross-functional understanding of open positions across the organization.\nShare responsibility for building teams across all departments.\nEncourage\ninternal mobility\nand career growth for existing employees.\n🎯 Results\nAttract high-potential candidates from diverse backgrounds.\nBuild long-term\ntalent forecasts and mapping\nto anticipate hiring needs.\nMake talent a\nstrategic priority\n: hiring the right person at the right time.\nTransform human capital from a cost into a\nstrategic asset\n.\nMeasure employee engagement and candidate experience, collecting feedback to improve.\n⚡ Efficiency\nRespect the time of both candidates and employees.\nMaintain a\nstandardized, repeatable, well-documented process\n.\nShare best practices across the organization.\nExpand talent search to new geographies when appropriate to optimize investment.\n🔍 Transparency\nDocument and update every step of the process.\nEnsure candidates know timelines and stages in advance.\nProvide feedback to\nall candidates\n, regardless of outcome.\nShare results and difficulties openly within the company.\nProvide constructive feedback to rejected candidates when requested.\nAnnounce open positions internally before publishing externally.\nHiring Process\nRoles and Accountability in the Selection Process\nThe recruitment and selection process at Agile Lab involves several key roles, each with specific responsibilities to ensure efficiency, fairness, and transparency.\nRecruiter (HR Team)\nThe recruiter manages the early phases of the process and coordinates the entire selection journey.\nResponsibilities include:\nChecking the\nDeny List\nbefore contacting a candidate.\nMonitoring and controlling the candidate journey across processes and tools\nCommunicating with candidates, moving them through the platform stages, and ensuring that all data and feedback are properly recorded.\nSending standard offers to candidates and manage communication towards Consulting and Witboost circles.\nTechnical Interviewer\nThe technical interviewer is responsible for evaluating the candidate’s skills and practical knowledge.\nDuties include:\nReviewing written test results and/or conducting\n1–2 technical rounds\ndepending on seniority.\nProviding structured feedback directly into the Talent Center, marking outcomes as positive or negative.\nRejecting out-of-scope candidates directly in the system if the outcome is negative.\nScheduling and conducting the second technical interview (for mid/senior profiles) within specific due dates.\nThe technical interviewer plays a central role in documenting results and ensuring that decisions are evidence-based.\nThe technical interviewer's evaluation is the primary driver to set the standard compensation.\nHiring Manager\nThe hiring manager usually steps in for more senior profiles and is accountable for the\nfinal hiring decision\n.\nKey tasks are:\nConducting a\ncultural fit interview\n(mainly for higher-level candidates, e.g., Engineering Level ≥ 3).\nCollaborating with HR to define contract details and compensation.\nApproving and formalizing offers in the Talend Manager  (statuses: Offered, Accepted, Declined).\nProviding justification and feedback in case of rejection or cultural misalignment.\nTogether, these three roles —\nRecruiter, Technical Interviewer, and Hiring Manager\n— ensure that Agile Lab’s recruitment process remains structured, transparent, and aligned with company values. The recruiter safeguards compliance and process consistency, the technical interviewer ensures skill alignment, and the hiring manager guarantees cultural fit and business alignment.\nThe Hiring Process\nThe Hiring Process follows this flow:\nCapacity & Recruiting Plan\nApplication Channels Activation\nCandidate journey\nOnboarding\nCapacity & Recruiting Plan\nRecruting campaigns are renewed every week in sych with the Capacity Management.\nSee\nConsulting Management\nfor further information.\nApplication Channels Activation\nApplications are collected from different channels depending on priorities and opportunities:\nVoluntary applications\nDirect contacts\nReferrals\nInterns\nSuppliers\nVoluntary applications\nA candidate voluntary applies to a job position from the\ncareer portal\n.\nWe want to receive\na single application matching the best match on the basis of skills and competences\n.\nA voluntary application can be for an open job position (linked to a business need) or as expression of interest for future positions.\nAgile Lab\nbenefits\nalso include the ability to earn a bonus via Referral.\nJob positions currently closed but open to applications report the following message:\nSpontaneous application: the position is currently closed, but don’t miss the chance to submit your application! We will get back to you as soon as the selection process reopens, if your profile matches our needs.\nWe retain such applications for\nsix months\nafter which we consider them expired.\nDirect contacts\nIf we are actively contacting a candidate, it is strongly recommended starting with a Background check.\nReferral\nAgile Lab\nbenefits\nalso include the ability to earn a bonus via Referral.\nIn order to be valid, the Referral must be \"proactive\": the Referrer (i.e. the employee in Agile Lab) must actively recommend the new candidate.\nThere are two types of Referral fees:\nType A\n: Employees can suggest a friend, an ex-colleague, a classmate at University, so a trusted person who will bring added value to the company, with at least 3 years of experience (the suggested person should comply with a senior profile). If that person is hired successfully, the referrer shall be prized with € 1.500 gross value that will be paid when the trial period of the neo-hired person will be over.\nType B\n: Employees who suggest people met in a corporate or private setting, or online (webinars, social media, chats such as Telegram, and so on), and tell them about the positive experience in Agile Lab, convincing them to send their CV. If they have at least 3 years experience (the suggested person should comply with a senior profile), and any of them are successfully hired, the referrer will be rewarded with €200 Amazon gift that will be paid when the trial period of the neo-hired person will be over. Only 2 type B referral are available per year per employee.\nPlease note:\nIf the candidate, type A or B, has been already previously contacted by Recruiters, the Referral will be not valid.\nReferral of newly graduated, or without experience, candidates will always be greatly appreciated, even if it will not result in any benefit.\nWe cannot hire people from all companies, please take a look at the recruiting\n*Deny List\n(available at\nsharepoint:BigData/HR/denylist recruiting.xlsx\n) before suggesting a candidate.\nWho is eligible for the referral fee, and for which referred candidates is it granted? See the table on the\nContracts\npage for details.\nWhat to do:\nEmployees can send the CVs to Recruiters and tell them what is their relationship with the candidate and the consequent Type of Referral.\nIf the candidate is eventually hired, the Recruiter will email the Administrative Department, to indicate to whom the referral is due: it will be paid, as said as above, after the end of a successful trial period.\nInterns\nWhen an internship is about to finish, in order to move towards a full/time employment a tech interview round is necessary. The interviewer should not know at all the candidate so that we can judge skills and capabilities without personal bias.\nSuppliers\nSuppliers can submit CVs for their candidates from the dedicated career portal account of the Talent Center.\nCandidate journey\nThe candidate journey is a process structured through the following steps:\nIN ARRIVAL\nFUTURE\nTECHNICAL SCREENING\nTECH ROUND(S)\nHR INTERVIEW\nBACKLOG\nOFFER\nONBOARDING\nIN ARRIVAL\nApplications are collected in the Talent Center.\nRecruiter responsibilities\n:\nCheck candidate against the\ndenylist\n(SharePoint).\nAdd contact details into\nContact List\n(SharePoint).\nUpload CV into Talent Center, tagging source (referral, direct, etc.).\nConduct\npre-screening call\nand update candidate status to “Contacted”.\nSend written test link; update status to “Written Test”.\nFUTURE\nCandidates not meeting\nbasic requirements\nare archived with a courtesy rejection.\nCandidates who cannot yet be hired but might be of interest (e.g., non-urgent need, external constraints) may be placed into a\nFuture Opportunities pool\nand noticed by email.\nSpecific requirements from our current Demand Plan can influence a decision for a move to the state FUTURE. Non-EU citizens or out-of-scope profiles may be flagged here.

    "title": "Agile Lab — Responsible AI Usage Policy",
    "section": "Internal IT",
    "level": "1.4.7",
    "text": "Agile Lab — Responsible AI Usage Policy\nIntroduction\nAt Agile Lab, we embrace AI as a tool to\nenhance execution, accelerate learning, and amplify productivity\n, never to replace critical thinking, engineering rigor, or our commitment to our clients’ trust.\nThis policy sets principles, rules, and best practices for using AI tools — including large language models (LLMs) — in a way that aligns with our strategic goals, our high engineering standards, and our obligations under law and client agreements.\nThis policy exists to ensure that AI is used\nresponsibly, safely, and effectively\n, protecting our clients, our colleagues, and our reputation.\nCultural Commitment\nWe believe AI can empower us to work faster and learn more — but it does not replace our engineering discipline, creativity, or professional responsibility.\nBy following these principles, we protect our clients, our colleagues, and our reputation as trusted engineers.\nRemember\n: If you’re not sure —\ndon’t share\n. Ask first.\nThe Risk of Over-Reliance\nRecent studies have shown that\nheavy dependence on AI tools can reduce our cognitive engagement and problem-solving capacity\n:\nStanford University (2023)\nfound that participants relying on AI assistants performed worse on novel problem-solving tasks, suggesting a reduction in independent thinking and creativity.\nNature Human Behaviour (2023)\nreported that using AI for writing reduced users’ ability to recall information and generate original ideas afterwards.\n(Sources: Stanford HAI, Nature Human Behaviour, 2023)\nWhile AI accelerates execution,\nover-relying on it can impoverish our human capital\n– our ability to reason deeply, invent solutions, and understand complex systems. For Agile Lab, these capabilities are our core strength and market differentiation.\nOur Strategic Focus: Human Capital Development\nIn an era where tools and frameworks are everywhere, and with AI excelling in narrow and vertical tasks what really makes us valuable isn’t just\nknowing one thing really well\n, but being able to\nconnect the dots across domains\n, understand how everything fits together in real-world systems, and design solutions that actually work.\nAt Agile Lab, we aim to grow\nT-shaped engineers\n:\nPeople with a\nsolid core\nin software engineering, distributed systems, and quality practices\nAnd with enough\nbreadth\nto understand architecture, business models, and how their code impacts the bigger system\nThis means focusing our growth on:\nSeeing the big picture\n: knowing why we’re building something, how it delivers value, and what the real goals are – beyond just “making it work”\nUnderstanding system and enterprise architecture\n: so we can design software that scales, is maintainable, and stays secure in the messy reality of production\nLearning patterns and practices\n: not just copying solutions, but knowing the design trade-offs, and when to apply each pattern for security, cost, and long-term evolvability\nWe’re not asking everyone to stop loving code. On the contrary –\nwriting great code becomes way more meaningful when you know how it fits into a bigger system, solves real problems, and supports goals that matter\n.\nProviding Context Responsibly\nAI outputs are only as good as the context we provide.\nIt is the\nresponsibility of each professional\nto ensure that any prompt or input given to AI systems includes:\nPrecise, clear context\nabout the problem, constraints, and objectives\nSystemic constraints and dependencies\nrelevant to the task or domain\nUnique considerations, nuances, and insights that draw from our expertise\nConnections between dots\nthat a general-purpose AI model cannot infer without explicit guidance\nWithout context rooted in our expertise,\nAI outputs will be generic, standard, and disconnected from the real problem\n. This is where we make the difference as professionals: by ensuring AI is working with\nthe right information, grounded in reality, and with proper quality standard in mind\n.\nThe Power of Human Relationships\nOur impact does not come only from technical skill. It is amplified by our\nhuman intelligence\n:\nBuilding meaningful relationships with colleagues, stakeholders, and clients\nDeveloping\nemotional intelligence\n: awareness, empathy, and the ability to read the room\nCultivating\nactive listening\n: understanding what is really needed, beyond what is requested\nFocusing on what truly matters\n: what the software or data product must achieve, what characteristics it must have, what risks it mitigates, what opportunities it enables\nAnticipating reactions\n: thinking ahead to how users, clients, and peers will interpret, use, and respond to our solutions\nAI as an Amplifier, Not a Replacement\nAI can assist us in execution, accelerate our learning, and inspire alternative viewpoints – but\nit cannot create purpose, propose context, or build relationships\n. These remain uniquely human capabilities.\nTherefore, at Agile Lab, we commit to:\nUsing AI to\naugment\nour thinking, not to replace it\nContinuing to\ninvest in our human capital\n, growing our ability to connect dots, understand complexity, and shape impactful solutions\nProtecting the\nquality of our thinking\n, our creativity, and our relationships, as they are the foundation of our excellence\nChallenging both the context we provide and the outputs we receive\n: an effective technique is to always ask\n“What are the drawbacks of this solution?”\n,\n“What problems to you see with this?”\nwhether it’s a piece of code, an architectural proposal, or a document draft. This habit deepens our understanding, reveals trade-offs, and prevents us from overfitting to the most probable or default answer, enabling better decisions and true learning.\nRemember\n: If you’re not sure –\npause and think first\n, then ask.\nGuiding Principles\nAI is for execution and learning — not for thinking or decision-making\nUse AI to automate repetitive tasks, generate drafts, speed up documentation, and support continuous learning.\nDo not rely on AI to make architectural or strategic decisions, or to replace human judgment.\nHuman accountability is non-negotiable\nEvery output produced or assisted by AI must be reviewed, validated, and owned by a responsible team member.\nAI cannot be a substitute for engineering due diligence, secure design, or quality assurance. We stand out in front of our customers and stakeholders, and we take responsibility.\nSecurity and confidentiality are paramount\nTreat all AI interactions as potential disclosures. Never input confidential client or company data unless fully approved and protected.\nAny breach of this principle puts client trust — and our reputation — at risk.\nSolid foundations come first\nAI is powerful only in the hands of professionals with strong fundamentals in software engineering, system design, troubleshooting, and secure coding.\nThese are the qualities we look for in candidates and develop in our teams.\nTransparency and compliance build trust\nWe use AI openly, responsibly, and always in line with GDPR, NDAs, and our contractual obligations.\nWhen AI contributes significantly to a deliverable, this must be traceable internally.\nBest Practices for Safe AI Use\nMask sensitive data\n. Remove client names, internal IDs, keys, or URLs. Use generic placeholders.\nNever assume outputs are accurate\n. Always verify facts, run tests, and check for security issues — especially in AI-generated code.\nCheck for licensing issues\n. Treat AI output like third-party code: review it for originality and compliance.\nDocument significant AI assistance\n. Note in commit messages or docs if AI generated a major section.\nGet approval for unusual uses\n. If in doubt, escalate to your manager or the designated AI governance contact.\nStay informed\n. This policy will evolve as technology and regulations change — keep up to date and ask when unsure.\nPolicy\n1.\nClient Data, Documents, and Code\nProhibited\n: Uploading any client data, documents, or software — in any form — to external AI tools (including private subscriptions) is forbidden\nwithout explicit, written consent\nfrom the client.\nAt this stage: No exceptions based on assumed security features of an AI vendor.\nUpload only if:\nYou have received written consent from the customer, provided to Internal IT (as explained later)\nYou are using an AI tool provided by Internal IT\nAllowed\n: The customer provides AI Tools and LLM subscriptions with related usage policies.

This model carries perverse incentives for individuals to garner attention for themselves for work that was performed by a group.\n(Gretchen Anderson,\nMastering Collaboration: Make Working Together Less Painful And More Productive\n, O'Reilly, 2019)\nContributing to collaborative learning provides:\nA safe space to\nlearn how to learn by teaching\n.\nExample\n: choose a small topic, gather info from research or your personal practice, then share your findings to other practitioners.\nA safe space to\nexercise facilitation skills\n.

The word facilitate means “to make easier,” and facilitation enables a group to work together more easily and effectively. Transformative facilitation is a structured and creative way to help diverse groups\nremove obstacles, bridge differences, and move forward together\n.\n(Adam Kahane,\nFacilitating Breakthrough\n, Berret-Koehler Publishers, 2021)\nThe role of structure in a collaborative learning setting is:\nProviding just enough structure and guardrails to help a team\nfeel safe and have room to maneuver helps keep people focused\n.\n(Adam Kahane,\nFacilitating Breakthrough\n, Berret-Koehler Publishers, 2021)"

The onboarding period last 2 weeks, and the main goals of the buddy in these amount of time are:\norganize and support the new team member study about the tech stack\nexplain our internal processes and transmit the cultural values that make Agile Lab work and evolve step after step\nInternal Sharing\nThe list of the topics that should be covered by buddies during each onboarding can be found in the\nonboarding section\n. The list highlights what to explain, but not how to do that, on which aspects put more focus, how to handle new team members with different seniority, and so on.\nIt's ok to not having a common way of explaining things, because it allows buddies to use their creativity, experience and empathy to design the best experience candidate after candidate. In Agile Lab, we leave total freedom to people about their way of working, but, at the same time, we strongly believe the socializing ideas and using collective intelligence to solve complex problems elevates our practices to the next level.\nThat's why we introduced the \"buddy internal sharing\", a recurrent meeting where buddies can discuss old onboarding experiencse and brand new ideas for the future ones.\nThese are example questions that can perfectly fit this kind of meetings:\n\"How do you explain the handbook? Do you just say that is a process collector or do you bring some example to the table?\"\n\"How do you onboard an engineering manager?\"\n\"How do you onboard a new team member already proficient with our tech stack?\"\n\"How do we introduce our culture in smooth way to people that comes from a rigid corporate culture?\"\n\"Did you ever onboard two new team members at the same time? Do you think it was productive?\"\n\"Are you able to create high engagement at the end of the onboarding weeks?\"\n\"Are two weeks enough to onboard new team members?\"\nOf course, this is not the list we use as the agenda of the meetings, it just brings you an idea of the kind of topics discussed in these sharing sessions.\nBuddies should periodically discuss these kind of topics to iterate, getting feedback, and crafting the perfect onboarding experience for new team members.\nHow to become a buddy\nThe requirements\nTo be able to explain the company culture, it is important that you have experienced certain aspects:\nTenure: A minimum of one year of employment with the company.\nFeedback Experience: Participation in both giving and receiving feedback through 360 reviews.\nOKR Understanding: A solid grasp of our OKR framework and how it aligns with our goals.\nHandbook Contribution: Involvement in creating or updating or discussing our company handbook.\nPurpose Articulation: The ability to clearly explain our company purpose.\nValue Alignment: The ability to explain our values, providing real-world examples.\nHolaspirit Experience: experience as facilitator or secretary\nDon’t worry if you don’t meet all of these requirements\n. We’re committed to your growth and development, and we’ll provide opportunities for you to gain the necessary skills. For example, if you have never been a facilitator, we can do it in the training circle.\nThe hiring process\nIf the buddy's role is related to hiring (indicated by the appropriate badge in Holaspirit), reach out to the circle lead or another buddy role filler for more information. A meeting will be scheduled with other buddies to assess your skills and identify any areas for development.\nTo help you get started, a buddy will pair you with an experienced buddy who will guide you through the onboarding process and provide ongoing feedback.\nBuddies/tutors Guidelines\nLeadership in Agile Lab starts from day 1. Keep in mind that first impressions count.\nGood buddies:\ntreat new colleagues as peers, be their mentor but let them express their leadership skills too\nput a lot of focus on the company culture and values\nit should be clear not only WHAT is self-management, but WHY we decided to adopt such a methodology to carry on with our daily work\ndon't give solutions before people struggle with the problem. The tradeoff between struggling and spending too much time on that task is up to you\nprovide good examples of how the onboarding training topics can be useful and applicable in real-world use cases, this is a source of great motivation\nconstantly stimulate creative and critical thinking, always in a goal-oriented way\nappreciate the good, fix the bad\nmake people feel part of the team since the first conversation\nBad buddies:\nonly care about technicalities\nreview the work in a \"yes or no\" fashion, without discussing the good and bad\nare not empathic\nonly talk about work kinds of stuff\nhave the webcam disabled during the video calls"

    "text": "Consulting Operating Framework\nThis document describes the organizational model of Agile Lab Consulting services.\nIt is based on Business Units (customer-focused) and Practice Units (people-focused).\nWe separate practices into\nwide\nand\nnarrow\n, with the goal of ensuring operational efficiency, technical quality, and coordination between Business Units (BUs), Practice Units (PUs), the Engineering Director, the Engineering Office, and the Consulting Lead.\nFoundational Principles\nDistinction Between Wide and Narrow Practices\nWide Practices\nThese are practices with a large number of people, widely distributed across BUs, and relatively easy to allocate.\nThey generally have\nmore uniform and stable workloads\n, allowing for direct management at the BU level with minimal need for central coordination.\nTypical characteristics:\nhigh population\nskills widely distributed across the company\nlimited variability in required seniority\neasier to staff and manage turnover\nNarrow Practices\nThese are practices with specialized, or critical competencies, scarce availability of resources and often with variable or intensive workloads.\nThey require strong governance, planning, and capacity control.\nTypical characteristics:\nlimited or hard-to-find talents\nhigh variability in technical skill requirements\nelevated risk of conflicts between BUs\nstrong impact on technical quality and project success\nGoals of the Model\nAutonomy and speed for mature, widely distributed practices (wide).\nQuality, supervision, and optimal utilization for specialist practices (narrow).\nUnified technical governance to avoid divergent methodologies.\nClear, repeatable decision processes for allocation, capacity, and business priorities.\nFlexible structure to support practice evolution over time.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nConsulting Lead\nThe Consulting Lead ensures\nstrategic and business alignment\nacross all BUs.\nKey responsibilities:\nDefine company-wide\ngo-to-market priorities\n.\nAlign BUs to a unified client and industry strategy.\nRepresent business interests in escalations.\nArbitrate cross-BU conflicts tied to pipeline or strategic accounts.\nSupport large deals and define delivery engagement models.\nEnsure that organizational structures support commercial goals.\nEngineering Director\nThe Engineering Director manages\ncompany-wide capacity alignment and talent distribution\n.\nKey responsibilities:\nOwn the\ncompany-wide capacity plan\n.\nBalance staffing across BUs and PUs based on demand.\nSupport PUs with short-term and long-term capacity planning.\nFor wide practices, resolve conflicts between BUs and support complex allocations, including reallocating resources for strategic initiatives\nProvide input on technical feasibility for bids and staffing plans.\nCollaborate with the\nEngineering Office\non technical matters impacting capacity.\nDefine\nstandard\nsalaries\nBusiness Unit (BU) Lead\nThe BU Lead is responsible for the\ncommercial and delivery success\nof a specific customer portfolio.\nKey responsibilities:\nOwn\ncustomer success\n, revenue, and margin expectation of the BU.\nDefine\nbusiness priorities\n, staffing needs, and project timelines.\nManage\nwide practices\ndirectly within the BU\nOversee Delivery Units and ensure customer satisfaction.\nAct as primary decision-maker for\nwhat\nis needed and\nwhen\n.\nEscalate business conflicts to the Consulting Lead.\nProvide interview capacity to cover its own resource demand.\nPractice Unit (PU) Lead\n(Applies exclusively to narrow practices)\nThe PU Lead manages a scarcely available or highly specialized capability shared across multiple BUs.\nKey responsibilities:\nOwn\npeople allocation decisions\n: who is assigned where and for how long.\nEnsure\ntechnical excellence\n, training, and career development.\nOptimize\nutilization and capacity\nacross the company.\nMaintain standards, methodologies, and the practice’s knowledge base.\nRun interviews, staffing evaluations, and prioritization across BUs.\nResolve allocation conflicts between BUs.\nCollaborate with the Engineering Office on technical governance.\nEngineering Office Lead\nThe Engineering Office ensures\ncoherent engineering standards\nacross the entire organization.\nKey responsibilities:\nDefine engineering principles, methodologies, and quality guidelines.\nProvide technical supervision over wide and narrow practices.\nEnsure consistency of delivery approaches across BUs and PUs.\nSupport PUs in designing career paths and skill frameworks.\nAct as the highest-level authority for technical disagreements.\nSupport solution design for complex engagements.\nDelivery Unit (DU) Lead\nA DU Lead oversees\noperational delivery\nfor a set of projects or customer segments within a BU.\nKey responsibilities:\nEnsure on-time, on-budget delivery.\nManage teams from wide practices and borrowed narrow-practice resources.\nMaintain visibility on risks, staffing, and customer satisfaction.\nReport performance to the BU Lead.\nIntegrate PU-assigned resources into delivery workflows (T&M models).\nCoordinate with the PU Lead and Engineering Office for technical supervision.\nPractice Members\n(Engineers, Scientists, Analysts, Project Managers, Services Managers, etc.)\nIndividual agilers belonging to a practice, whether wide or narrow.\nKey responsibilities:\nExecute delivery work aligned with Engineering Office standards.\nMaintain and develop their technical competencies.\nContribute to practice knowledge, assets, and methodologies.\nParticipate in interviews, assessments, and training activities.\nCollaborate with BU and PU stakeholders on project expectations.\nHigh Level Operational Workflows\nNarrow Practices – Responsibility Flow\n(For all centrally managed practices)\nThe\nBU\ndefines what is needed and when.\nThe\nPU\nidentifies suitable resources and manages the entire allocation process.\nThe\nPU\nplans capacity based on BU forecasting and priorities.\nThe\nPU\nmanages interviews, assessments, staffing, and prioritization.\nThe\nPU\nresolves conflicts between BUs requiring the same skills.\nThe\nEngineering Office\nintervenes when conflicts involve technical standards.\nThe\nEngineering Director\nsupports global capacity planning.\nThe\nConsulting Lead\nresolves business-level conflicts.\nWide Practices – Responsibility Flow\n(For practices directly managed by BUs)\nThe\nBU\ndefines demand, timing, allocations, and operational management.\nThe\nBU\npreserve internal capacity for interviews and assigns resources to projects.\nThe\nEngineering Office\nsupervises adherence to technical standards.\nThe\nEngineering Director\n:\nintervenes in conflicts between BUs,\nsupports or enforces reallocation,\nbalances demand and availability.\nThe\nConsulting Lead\nintervenes in commercial escalations and strategic positioning.\nRationale\nEfficiency in managing scarcely available or specific skills (narrow)\nAvoids underutilization, conflicts, and fragmentation of methodologies.\nAutonomy and speed for widely available skills (wide)\nReduces overhead and increases responsiveness of BUs to customer demand.\nUnified technical governance\nMaintains quality, consistency, and engineering identity across the company.\nStructural flexibility\nPractices can shift from wide to narrow (or vice versa) based on company growth, market trends, or talent availability.\nDelivery Management Framework\nDelivery management between BUs and PUs follows two distinct engagement models, depending on whether the BU delegates delivery responsibility to the PU or borrows resources while retaining control.\nThese models clarify accountability, reporting lines, and operational collaboration.\nPU-Delivered Work (Fixed-Budget Services)\nIn this model, the\nBU delegates a fully scoped piece of work\nto the PU under a fixed budget and expected outcomes.\nCore principles:\nThe\nPU owns end-to-end delivery responsibility\nfor the delegated scope.\nThe\nBU remains accountable for customer management and revenue and margin expectation\nbut does not participate in day-to-day delivery decisions.\nDelivery execution, staffing, planning, and risk management are performed by the PU.\nThe PU must adhere to engineering standards defined by the Engineering Office.\nRequired reporting from PU to BU:\nCompletion status and milestone tracking\nEfficiency metrics and productivity insights\nDelivery risks, incidents, and blockers\nQuality indicators and technical debt\nOpportunities for upsell, optimization, or scope expansion\nThis model is appropriate for:\nspecialized delivery chunks requiring narrow-practice expertise\nself-contained service components\npredictable or well-defined deliverables\nBU-Delivered Work (Effort-Based / T&M Services)\nIn this model, the\nBU borrows individuals from a PU\nbut retains full delivery responsibility.\nCore principles:\nThe\nBU owns delivery management\n, planning, sprint execution, and customer communication.\nBorrowed PU members are integrated into\nBU Delivery Units\n, following BU processes and cadence.\nThe BU is responsible for reporting progress, risks, and outcomes to the customer and internal stakeholders.\nWhat the BU must report internally:\nPerformance and integration of borrowed individuals\nDelivery progress and blockers involving PU resources\nResource utilization, deployment, and planned burn\nWhat the PU remains responsible for:\nTechnical supervision of its practice members\nPerformance reviews and skill development\nEnsuring individuals comply with engineering standards\nThis model is appropriate for:\nbroader delivery initiatives fully owned by the BU\ncross-functional projects\nsituations where specialist skills are needed within a BU-managed team\nflexible resourcing scenarios or mixed teams\nSummary of Accountability by Delivery Model\nActivity\nFixed-Budget (PU-delivered)\nT&M / Effort-Based (BU-delivered)\nEnd-to-end delivery\nPU\nBU\nStaffing decisions\nPU\nPU assigns; BU deploys\nDaily task management\nPU\nBU\nReporting to BU\nPU\nBU\nReporting to customer\nBU\nBU\nPerformance management\nPU\nPU (for people), BU (for delivery)\nTechnical governance\nEng Office → PU\nEng Office → BU & PU\nRevenue and margin expectation ownership\nBU\nBU\nThis two-model system enables BUs to scale delivery efficiently while ensuring PUs maintain technical rigor and maximize the value of deeply specialized capabilities.\nHiring Technical Interviews\nBusiness and Practice Units must support People for technical interviews:\nPractice Units\nmust plan their own capacity for technical interviews\nmanage hirings for narrow practices\nBusiness Units\nmust plan their own capacity for technical interviews of wide practices\ndo not directly hire\nEng Directors\nmanage hirings for wide practices\nEvolution of Practices: From Narrow to Wide\nA practice classified as\nnarrow\ntoday may evolve into a\nwide\npractice over time as the company grows, the talent pool expands, or the market demand stabilizes.\nConditions That Lead to a Narrow Practice Becoming Wide\nA narrow practice can transition to wide status when several of the following conditions emerge:\nIncreased Population\nThe number of professionals in the practice grows enough to allow effective distribution across multiple BUs.\nGreater Competency Distribution\nSkills become more standardized, more widely available, or easier to train internally.\nReduced Specialization Pressure\nThe practice’s activities become more repeatable, lowering the need for centralized control and specialized allocation.\nStable and Predictable Demand\nWorkload patterns stabilize across BUs, making capacity planning more straightforward and less conflict-prone.\nMature Governance and Standards\nMethodologies and best practices mature enough to be easily supervised by the Engineering Office without requiring a full PU structure.\nHow the Transition Happens\nThe\nPU\n, BUs, and Engineering Director periodically review practice maturity and utilization data.\nWhen the practice meets the conditions above, a proposal to reclassify it from narrow to wide is initiated.\nThe\nEngineering Office\nvalidates that technical standards can be maintained in a BU-managed model.\nThe\nConsulting Lead\nevaluates the commercial impact of decentralizing the practice.\nUpon approval, responsibilities shift gradually:\ncapacity and staffing are handed over to the BUs,\ngovernance transitions from PU to BU management under Engineering Office supervision,\nthe PU structure is scaled down or repurposed.\nReferences\nProject Lifecycle Management\nResource Management\nPeople Management\nBid Management\nCommunication & Knowledge

> BU Leads > Sub BU Leads > Project Leads > Team Members\nHolaspirit is the source of truth for coaching.\nCoaches are responsible for the overall coaching (soft+hard skills, career path, etc.), nevertheless coaches are usually technically expert of a few areas.\nWe have cross-functional teams, a single team contains all the flavours.\nFor this reason, Agile Lab guarantees a proper technical mentorship to everyone through a proper assignment of technical mentors.\nTechnical mentorship is organized as follows:\nDefault: a coach is also a practice mentor, this applies whenever their tech profiles are aligned, this is the most common case;\nExplicit assignement: a coach cannot directly help on technical mentorship, thus a practice mentor is assigned explicitely\nPractices Organization\nA Practice Lead organizes the practice and facilitates knowledge sharing with Practice Leads/Principals, ensuring alignment with tech strategy execution\nPractice Leads proactively

innovation, technical excellence, and knowledge sharing\nHas no responsibility over staffing, performance evaluation, or delivery\nCollaborates with coaches to integrate technical growth into personal development plans, without interfering in delivery or project dynamics\nMutual Respect and Boundaries\nIn order to preserve a balanced and collaborative environment based on self-management and distributed authority, the following behaviors are\nto be avoided\n:\n❌\nPractice Leads/Principals must not interfere with delivery choices\n, team capacity planning, or coaching performance evaluations.\n❌\nPractice Leads/Principals should not propose or promote staffing changes\n, reassignments, or shifts in project involvement.\n❌\nPractice Leads/Principals must avoid advocating for or against specific projects\n, clients, or delivery decisions that fall outside the practice's technical goals.\n❌\nCoaches should not Practice Leads/Principals must avoid advocating for or against specific projects\n, clients, or delivery decisions that fall outside the practice's technical goals.\n❌\nCoaches should not ndermining Practice Leads’ expertise or direction\n, coaches must trust and support the work of Practice Leads, not question their relevance or attempt\nTo support a healthy collaboration, the following are\nexpected behaviors\n:\n✅ Practice Leads/Principals\nfocus on technical growth\n, knowledge sharing, and long-term capability building.\n✅ Coaches\nfocus on individual development\n, delivery health, and people care.\n✅ Both roles\ncommunicate openly\n, align on mutual goals, tech strategy, and best practices and maintain clear boundaries of responsibility.\n✅ Issues at the intersection of the two roles are\nescalated constructively\nto the Engineering Director when needed.\n✅\nCoaches should promote and help planning access to technical mentorship\n, even when not directly involved in a practice.\nThis approach ensures that each role acts as a\ncomplementary force\nfor growth, excellence, and autonomy across Agile Lab.\nIn a self-managed context like Agile Lab, this division of responsibilities ensures a distributed, respectful, and

    "section": "Consulting",
    "level": "1.7.5",
    "text": "Tech Strategy\nThe tech strategy for the Consulting circle mainly focuses on tech/engineering functions, but anyway requires synergy and integrations from Sales and Marketing.\nThe general pillars for crafting a good strategy are:\nBalancing Innovation with Core Strengths\n: Exploring new areas while maintaining the core values outlined in the Elite Data Engineering Manifesto, striking a good balance between innovation and leveraging established strengths. This dual focus is essential in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. While the company grows is important also to stick with our roots and be sure the whole company is capable to deliver on promises.\nAdaptability and Market Sensitivity\n: It's crucial to stay adaptable and sensitive to market changes, especially in technology and data engineering. Customer and Prospect probing to acquire relevant information is crucial, don't follow hype without any grounding on our target and addressable market\nRevenue Generation vs. Value Creation\n: While generating revenue is a primary goal, it's also important to consider long-term value creation for our clients. This includes not just immediate financial benefits but also enhancing their capabilities, agility, and competitive edge.\nRisk Management in Innovation\n: While exploring new areas, especially those with potential for high market disruption, a calculated approach to risk management is necessary. It's important to validate the stability and reliability of new technologies and methodologies before fully committing resources. In many areas big vendors can disrupt consulting value propositions by creating SaaS and automated offerings\nThought Leadership and Skill Development\n: Continuing to establish thought leadership is a priority. Concurrently, upskilling and reskilling the team in new emerging areas will ensure staying ahead in the market. Pay attention that reskilling is not happening in a short time, so innovation and value proposition must take reskilling in account to create feasible adoption plans.\nClient-Centric Approach\n: We need to stick with a client-centric approach, focusing on specific customer needs and market gaps. \nFuture-Proofing through Research and Development: Investing in R&D not only prepares us for future market demands but also positions us as innovators in the field. Innovation should never be auto-referential, but it should be always linked to potential new business for the company.\nWhen we create a new strategy we focus mainly on four areas, and foreach of them we need to identify areas of interest, topics, methodologies and technologies:\nThought leadership\n: we aim to establish Agile Lab or its reliable representatives as experts on a particular topic, and we want to do this possibly at a global level to support our internationalization process. Thought leadership is important to drive credibility and trust of our value propositions.\nValue proposition\n: clearly define what we are proposing to the client, what problems it solves, and the benefits it brings to them. When we decide to add something new to our global value proposition, we need to create supportive material for sales and marketing, and we need to be sure we are capable to deliver what we promise.\nCompetencies\n: after selling a project, we must deliver on promises to create trust and fuel the business. Therefore, it is necessary to develop skills in all the areas included in the strategy and all the aspects of our core strengths. From this we decline the training and certiication programs for the entire company\nInnovation\n: some topics that do not allow us to make an impact on the business now, but may do so in 2-3 years, so it is important to gain experience in areas we believe to be promising. This is pure research, but anyway it should be connected to consulting business opportunities.\nAll the elements included in the tech strategy must also be classified with different priorities: top - secondary - nice to have\nThe Process\nWhen:\nThe tech stratgy process starts at the beginning of the last quarter of the year, with the goal to release a self-explaining document by the end of january of the next year.\nParticipants:\nStakeholder: the CTO is the main driver of the process and the ultimate responsible for it\nContributors: All the Eng4 and upper levels in the ladder, belonging to consulting circle\nActivities:\nStep 1\n: At the beginning, all the contributors are required to work autonoummously to collect their understanding of the market and create a structured and written proposal about the oportunities they see for the next year, clarifying on which area ( Thought Leadership, Value Proposition, Competencies, Innovation) they would invest for each topic. In this phase each contributor can decide to involve his team or other peers.\nStep 2\n: Open discussion in one or two meetings, all the contributors explain their strategy to trigger other opinions and reasoning\nStep 3\n: CTO selects best ideas and prioritize them, creating a draft document ( MOU ) for the strategy and sharing it with the working group\nStep 4\n: Contributors provide final comments and suggestions about the strategy\nStep 5\n: CTO shares the strategy with the whole company"

Everybody in the team is asked to contribute and keep it updated.\nRunbook\nA runbook is an operational reference which is used to describe an application in a deployed environment. It should be easy to read, consistent across all services and accurate. \nThis is the document an on-call responder would refer to at 3am when a P1 alert wakes him/her up, so it should be as straightforward and to-the-point as possible.\nFor the same reasons, it should be always up to date. Each SRE Engineer is accountable for keeping his domains runbooks up to date.\nSince our team is accountable for more than a service, here we define a template that contains the main items of a runbook.\nTemplate\nSection\nPurpose\nSummary\nVery short description about the functionalities/services offered\nService SLA\nReport here ticket and service SLAs (if any) defined by contract\nEscalation path\nUseful for both the on-call team and customer\nIncident workflow\nHow is an incident created and how to behave\nMonitoring\nList here all the tool used for monitoring purposes (e.g. dashboards)\nAlerts\nFor each alert, or group of alerts, describe the meaning of the metric, the impact on the customer, and possible remediation checks\nPostmortems\nLink to the postmortem collection\nDoc\nAny link to documentation that can be relevant\nInternal tests\nA stable platform is likely to live few incidents in a year, but they will fiercly suprise you when you least expect them. And at that time, we really want all our team to be ready for it.\nInternal tests is the method that we enforce to assess the knowledge of the service. Aim of these trainings is to cover the following topics:\nProcess\n: is it clear how to behave during an incident? How to escalate and who to engage?\narchitecture\n: is it clear the purpose of each block of the application and what is its impact on the customer?\nTroubleshooting\n: here we go deep, issues are proposed in order to understand what the team member would do in that situation, what he/she would look at first and so on.\nmonitoring\n: is it clear what that alarm means? Is it documented enough?\nAn important aspect of internal tests is that they are particularly handy for who is approaching to jump into shifts. Moreover, they create an improvement loop whose aim is to fill the gaps emerged by the results.\nIndeed, when results are ready, a meeting takes place to review the questions and create corrective actions out of it.\nProjects\nProjects are defined as a sequence of activities aimed to reach a particular goal (e.g environment creation, tool development, performance optimization etc.)\nAs for a software project, we adopt company\nworkflows and guidelines\n.\nActivities vs. Incidents\nActivities\nActivities can be independent tasks, or can be part of a project.\nActivities are defined with the team leader\nYou can work on an activity if the related Gitlab issue has been defined\nYou should only work on one activity at a time\nEach activity is defined as follows (use related template):\nTitle, Description\nTasks\nComment feedback daily (on wip activity)\nDeadline\nDefinition of done\nAll activities are defined day by day using Agile methodology, which is repeated every day\nAll activities/MR should be reported in the customer's repository, while generic issues/MR should be reported in the team's internal repository\nAll activities/MR need to be labelled with standard tags/labels\nWhen activities/MR are ready, they are assigned for a review to the Team Leader\nIncidents\nIncidents are opened and managed using a ticket system, manually or automatically generated by proactive monitoring.\nIncidents are assigned to the on-call team member or properly routed to the correct person by means of the defined escalation path.\n[Definition of done]\nAt the end of the incident, when deemed appropriate, the post-mortem and resolution documentation can be produced (see postmortem section).\n[Definition of done]\nIf there is a business impact, during each phase of the incident the customers and stakeholders must be kept up to date and when it ends a report must be produced explaining what happened, actions taken and root causes\nPostmortem\nA postmortem goes beyond the documentation of an incident. It represents a detailed and blameless analysis of symptoms, root cause and timeline of the event, but it is mostly about sitting down to understand what corrective actions can be taken to prevent that issue to happen again, or to modify our processes in order to better behave in such situations.\nPostmortems are expected after any significant undesirable event. Writing them is a process that requires a considerable amount of time and effort, for this reason we have to choose when to write one, and there are specific triggers that help this decision:\ndata loss\non call team member intervention\nimpact on the business\nmonitoring failure\nrecurring events\nThe decision to draw up a postmortem is in charge of the SRE role that has a focus on that circle, mainly based on the above mentioned triggers. With respect to all on-call team members, he/she has a broader view on incident history. General usefulness should be taken into account too, as postmortems make up a knowledge base useful for all the SRE team members when facing similar problems.\nWhile the analysis and technical details of the incident are produced by the on-call team member, who is the only one that has a clear timeline of the events, this is just the 50% of the work.\nFor a postmortem to have a value, it needs to be reviewed by the team, which has to define and take charge of corrective actions.\nJoining the circle\nIf you want to candidate to join this circle, contact the lead link and tell him/her about it."

    "text": "Overview & Motivations\nThis has the dual purpose of raising awareness and acting as a manifesto for all the people at Agile Lab along with our past, present, and future customers.\nIn the collective imagination, the Data Engineer is someone who processes and makes data available to potential consumers. It's usually considered as a role focused on achieving a very practical result: get data there - where and when it's needed.\nUnfortunately, this rather short-sighted view led to big disasters in Enterprises and beyond and you know why?\nData Engineering is a practice, not (just) a role.\nIn the past, many professionals approached the \"extract value from data\" problem as a technological challenge, architectural at most (DWH, Data Lake, now Cloud-native SaaS based pipelines, etc …), but what has always been missing there is the awareness that Data Engineering is a practice, that as such needs to be studied, nurtured, built and disseminated.\nWe have always dissociated ourselves from this too simplistic vision of Data Engineering, conscious of possible misunderstanding by the market when expecting from us such kind of \"basic service\". We'd like to state this once again:\nData Engineering is not about moving data from one place to another, or executing a set of queries quickly (thanks to some technological help), or even \"supporting data scientists\". Data Engineering, as the word says, is\nengineering the data management practice\n.\nWhen we talk about Engineering, in a broader viewpoint, we aim precisely to this: designing detailed and challenged architectures, adopting methodologies, processes, best practices, and tools to craft reliable, maintainable, evolvable, reusable products and services that meet the needs of our society.\nWould you walk over a bridge made of some wooden planks (over and over again, maybe to bring your kids to school)?\nNow, we don't understand why some people talk about Data Engineering when, instead, they refer to just creating some data or implementing ETL/ELT jobs. It's like talking about Bridge Engineering while referring to putting some wooden planks between two pillars: here the wooden planks are the ETL/ELT processes connecting the data flows between two systems. Is this really how would you support an allegedly data-driven company?\nNow let's talk about data and how we manage it\nData is becoming the nervous system of every company, large or small, a fundamental element to differentiate on the market in terms of services offer and automated support to business decisions.\nIf we genuinely believe that they are such a backbone, we must treat them \"professionally\"; if we really consider them a good, a service, or a product, we must engineer them. There is no such thing as a successful product that has not been properly engineered. The factory producing such products has undoubtedly been super-engineered to ensure low production costs along with no manufacturing defects and high sustainability.\nWe believe that data is crucial, and we assume that this is just as true for our customers.\nThat's why we've been trying to engineer the data production and delivery process for years from a design, operation, methodology, and tooling perspective. Engineering the factory but not the product, or vice versa, definitely leads to failure in the real world. It is important to engineer the data production lifecycle and the data itself as a digital good, product, and service. Data does not have only one connotation, instead it is naturally fickle. It is a system that must stay balanced because, exactly as in quantum systems, the reality of data is not objective but depends on the observer.\nOur approach has always been to consider the data as the software (and in part, the data is software), but without forgetting the greater gravity (Data Gravity - in the Clouds - Data Gravitas).\nWe envision a world where top-notch Data Engineers make the difference for the success of a data-centric initiative.\nData teams will be more accountable for business outcomes, they'll have to work to the best of their ability to make sure their products are maintainable and evolvable over time. Their outcomes and quality will be measurable, objectively. It will be straightforward to differentiate teams working with high-quality standards from those performing poorly, and we sincerely look forward to this.\nToo many data engineers focus on tools and frameworks, but practices, concepts, and patterns matter even more. In fact,\nall technologies will inevitably become obsolete at some point, while good organizational, methodological, and engineering practices can last a long time.\nOur Data Engineering pratice is not focusing only on data. Still, it guarantees that the data will be of high quality, that it will be easy to find and correct errors, that it will be simple and inexpensive to maintain and evolve, and that it will be safe and straightforward to consume and to understand.\nIt's about practice, data culture, design patterns, broader sensitivity across many more aspects we might be used to when \"just dealing with software\". At Agile Lab, we invest every single day in continuous internal training and mentoring on this, because we believe that our Data Engineering practice will be the a key success factor for our customers.\nTime to show the cards.\nSo let's come to what we think are the characteristics and practices that should be part of a good Data Engineering process.\nData Processing\nSoftware Quality:\nThe software producing and managing data must be high-quality, maintainable, evolvable. There's no big difference between software implementing a data pipeline and a microservice in terms of quality standards! In terms of workflow, ours is public and open source. You can find it\nhere\nSoftware design patterns and principles must also be applied to data pipelines development. Please stop scripting data pipelines (notebooks didn't help here).\nDecoupling:\nIt has become a mantra in software systems to have well-decoupled components that are independently testable and reusable.\nWe use the same measures with different facets in data platforms and data pipelines.\nA data pipeline must:\nHave a single responsibility and a single owner of its business logic.\nBe self-consistent in terms of scheduling and execution environment.\nBe decoupled from the underlying storage system.\nI/O actions must be decoupled from business (data transformation) logic, so to facilitate testability and architectural evolutions.\nAlso, it is essential to have well-decoupled layers at the platform level, especially storage and computing.\nReproducibility:\nWe need to be able to re-run data pipelines in case of crashes, bugs, and other critical situations, without generating side effects. In the software world, corner case management is fundamental, just like (or even more) in the data one (because of gravity).\nWe design all data pipelines based on the principles of immutability and idempotence. Despite the technology, you should always be in the position to:\nRe-execute a pipeline gone wrong.\nRe-execute an hotfixed/patched pipeline to overwrite the last run, even if it was successful.\nRestore a previous version of the data.\nRun a pipeline in recovery mode if you need to clean up an inconsistent situation. The pipeline itself holds the cleaning logic, not another job.\nSo far, we have talked about data itself, but an even more critical aspect is the reproducibility of the underlying environments and platforms status. \nBeing able to (re)create an execution environment with no or minimal effort, drastically simplifies tasks such as on-the-fly tests, environment migrations, platform upgrades or simulating disaster recovery. It would also reduce the need of regression tests on large amounts of data.\nIt's an aspect to be taken care of and that can be addressed through IaC and architectural Blueprint methodologies.\nPerformance:\nPerformance and scalability are two engineering factors that are critical in every data-driven environment. In complex architectures, there can be hundreds of aspects with an impact on scalability and good data engineers should possess them as foundational design principles.\nOnce again, it is important to highlight the importance of a methodological approach. There are several best practices to encourage:\nAlways isolate the various read, compute, and write phases by running dedicated tests that will point out specific bottlenecks thus allowing better-targeted optimization: when you're asked to reduce the execution time of a pipeline by 10%, it must be clear which part of the process is worth working on. A warning here: isolating the various phases brings up the theme of decoupling and single responsibility. If your software design doesn't respect these principles, it won't be modular enough to allow clear steps isolation. For example, Spark has a lazy execution model where it is very hard to discern read times from transformation and write times if you are not prepared to do so.\nAlways run several tests on each phase with different (magnitudes of) data volumes and computing resources to extract scaling curves that will allow you to make reasonable projections when the reference scenario will change: it's always unpleasant to find out that input data is doubling in a week and we have got no idea of how many resources will be needed to scale up. In pipeline performance tests, the worst case scenario should be designed with a long-term data strategy in mind.\nData Documentation:\nDocumentation and metadata should follow the same lifecycle of code and data. Computational governance policies of the data platform should prevent new data initiatives to be brought into production if not well paired with the proper level of documentation and metadata. This is foundation for having good data products that are genuinely self-describing and understandable.\nHaving ex-post metadata creation and publishing can introduce a built-in technical debt ( data-debt) due to the potential misalignment with the actual data already available to consumers. It's then good practice to make sure that metadata resides within the same repositories of pipelines' code generating the data, which should imply synchronization between code and metadata and ownership by the very same team. For this reason, metadata authoring shouldn't take place on Data Catalogs, which are supposed to help consumers find out the information they need. Embedding a metadata IDE to cover malpractices in metadata management won't help in cultivating this culture.\nWhen we implement metadata is important to rely on open standards and don't re-invent the wheel.\nData Versioning:\nThe observability and reproducibility issues are rooted in the ability to move nimbly on data from different environments as well as from different versions in the same environment (e.g., rollback a terminated pipeline with inconsistent data).\nData, just like software, must be versioned and portable with minimum effort from one environment to another.\nMany tools can help (such as LakeFS), but when they are not available it's still possible to set up a minimum set of features allowing you to efficiently:\nRun a pipeline over an old version of data (e.g., for repairing or testing purposes)\nMake an old version of the data available in another environment.\nRestore an old version of the data to replace the current version.\nIt is critical to design these mechanisms from day zero because they can also impact other pillars.\nData Security:\nIt is part of an engineer's duties to take care of security, in general. In this case, data security is becoming a more and more important topic and must be approached with a by-design logic.\nIt's essential to look for vulnerabilities in your data and do it in an automated and structured way so to discover sensitive data before they go accidentally live.\nThis topic is very important at Agile Lab, so much that we have even developed proprietary tools to promptly find out if sensitive information is present in the data we are managing. These checks are continuously active, just like Observability checks.\nData Security at rest:\nFine-grained authentication and authorization mechanisms must exist to prevent unwanted access to (even just portion of) data (see RBAC, ABAC, Column and Row filters, etc…).\nData must be protected, and processing pipelines are just like any other consumer/producer so policies must be applied to storage and (application) users, that's also why decoupling is so important.\nSometimes, due to strict regulation and compliance policies, it's not possible to access fine-grained datasets, although aggregates or statistical calculations might still be needed. In this scenario, Privacy-Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) comes in handy. Any well-engineered data pipeline should compute its KPIs with the lowest possible privileges to avoid leaks and privacy violations (auditing arrives suddenly and when you don't expect it). Have fun the moment you need to ex-post troubleshoot a pipeline that embeds PPDM, which basically gives you no data context to start from!\nData Review:\nJust as code reviews are a good practice, a good data team should perform and document data reviews. These are carried out at different development stages and cover multiple aspects such as:\nDocumentation completeness\nSemantic and syntactic correctness\nSecurity and compliance\nData completeness\nPerformance / Scalability\nReproducibility and related principles\nTest cases analysis and monitoring (data observability)\nWe encourage adopting an integrated approach across code base, data versioning, and data issues.\nData Testing and Observability:\nTesting and monitoring must be applied to data, as well as to software, because static test cases on artifact data are just not enough. We do this by embracing the principles of DODD (\nKensu | DODD\n). Data testing means considering the environment and the context where data lives and is observed. Remember that data offers different realities depending on when and where it's evaluated, so it's important to apply principles of continuous monitoring to all the lifecycle stages, from development through deployment, not only to the production environment.\nWhen we need to debug or troubleshoot software we always try to have the deepest possible context. IDEs or various monitoring and debugging tools help by automatically providing the execution context (stack trace, logs, variables status, etc.) letting us to understand the system's state at that point in time.\nHow often did you see \"wrong data\" in a table having no idea on how it got there? How exhausting was finding the piece of code allegedly generating such data (hoping it's versioned and not hardcoded somewhere), trying to mentally re-create the corner case that might have caused the error, searching for unit tests supposedly covering such corner case, scraping the documentation hoping to find references of that scenario… It's frustrating, because data seems just plunged from the sky, with no traces left. Probably 99% of data pipelines implemented out there have no links between the input (data), the function (software) and the output (data) thus making troubleshooting or, even worse, the discovery of an error just a nightmare.\nIn Agile Lab, we apply the same principles seen for software: we always try to have as much context as possible to understand better what's happening to a specific data row or column. We try to set up lineage information (stacktrace), data profiling (general context) and data quality before and after the transformations we apply (execution context). All these information need to be usable right when needed and be well organized.\nThis practice is about people - professionals - not tools. Of course, many tools help in implementing the practice, but without the right mindsets and skills they are just useless.\nKeep in mind that ex-post checks don't solve quality problems because consumers in the mean time probably already ingested faulty data (remember the data gravity thing?) and they don't provide any clues about where and why the errors came up. This to say that it makes a huge difference\nto proactively anticipate checks and monitoring so to make them synchronous with the data generation\n(and part of applications-generating-data lifecycle).\nData Issues:\nAs seen in previous section, Data Observability provides capabilities to perform root cause analysis, but how do we document the issues? How do we behave when a data incident occurs? The last thing you want to do is to \"patch the data\"; what you need to do is fixing the pipelines (applications), which will then fix the data.\nFirst, the data issues should be reported just like any other software bug. They must be documented accurately, associating them with all the contextual information we extracted from the data observability, to clarify what would have been expected, what happened instead, what tests have been prepared and why they did not intercept the problem.\nIt is vital to understand the corrective actions at the application level (they could drive automatic remediation) as well as the additional tests that need to be implemented to cover the issue.\nAnother aspect to consider is the ability to associate data issues to the specific version of both software and data (data versioning) responsible of the issue because, sometimes, it's necessary to put in place workarounds to restore business functionality first. At the same time, while data and software evolve independently, we must reproduce the problem and fix it.\nFinally, to avoid repeating the same mistakes, it's crucial to conduct a post-mortem with the team and ensure these are saved in a simil-wiki or somehow associated with the issue, searchable and discoverable.\nData Interoperability:\nWe believe data should be easily accessible across the organization, there should not be barriers for data consumers to interact with data ( except security and authorization constrains). This high availability must also be paired with low coupling between who produces and exposes the data and who consumes it.\nThe first aspect are metadata, when we expose data they must be paired with\ndata contracts\nand\ndata sharing agreements\n.\nData Contracts\nshould be a standard way to describe the data and the terms of the offered service. Let's consider data as a service we offer to the organization. Terms of service should include SLO and SLA and how people can use the data we are offering ( for example only for development or testing purposes ).\nSLO and SLA instead should describe what level of quality we want to reach or we guarantee, also uptime, data downtime, timeliness, refresh rate should be described. \nData Contracts should follow the same life cycle of metadata and documentation see section \"Data Documentation\", but in the end they should be available to everybody in the organization ( no sensitive data here ) in a human and machine readable format, because they have a big role in decoupling data processing from data storage across domains or different stakeholders.\nData Sharing Agreements\nare an extension of Data Contracts and are more focusing on what is the intended usage, privacy and purpose ( including limitations ). For example, they should make clear if data filters will be applied for governance and security purposes or if some data life cycle policy is in place ( data deletion or data retention ). Data Sharing Agreements can be global or also specific for some set of consumers, but they need to be clear and understandable. They also follow the \"Data Documentation\" process, but they only need to be human readable. In any case, they are an important aspect for data interoperability, because they increase the consumer awareness.\nWhen focusing on the technical and physical aspects instead, we need to take care of how we expose the data. These are key aspects we need to keep in consideration to boost the interoperability:\nData is consumable from a single API/Interface/Connector and there is no need to integrate with several technologies to consume different data sets across the organization.\nData is consumable for different needs ( data exploration, dashboarding/reporting, data intensive processing ). When we expose data we don't overfit on a use case and we keep the door open for new use cases.\nThe consumer doesn't need to know the physical location of the data, because this is going to generate high coupling between producer and consumer. We want them to discover the physical location at runtime ( pre-flight pattern ) or otherwise refer to logical locations.\nData is exposed through open standards and protocols. They will facilitate the consumer to read the data with a multitude of tools and methods. This is also interoperability. \"Open\" means that there is a specification and then everybody can implement and extend it, but also that there is an ecosystem of tools adopting it. Open but not used in the industry is not enough."

    "text": "Workflow\nMaking Gitlab the beating heart of our workflow allows us to have a single source of truth about the status of a project, the development experience built around this system will have as values:\nContinuous improvement\n: The process is not rigid, it brings together heterogeneous experiences faced by AgileLab in the implementation of projects for customers, these experiences must continuously converge in the development process.\nDemocracy\n: The process is not rigid, it provides a way for change, as long as it is shared by all the actors involved.\nRecursiveness\n: The process by which the process is developed and modified is the process itself (eat your own dogfood)\nVisibility\n: The process must be able to give visibility on the status of the project at every level of detail necessary, this involves the timely collection of information at multiple levels of detail:\nGitlab Issues (Visibility on High level Design, Low level design, Work items)\nMerge request (Visibility on the integration of work items within the repository)\nCode Quality (Visibility on the quality of effort delivered)\nReproducibility\n:\nThe process must be able to answer questions in this format:\nGiven an output\nO\n, at what stage of the process was it produced?\nGiven an output\nO\n, from which input\nI\nwas produced?\nThe process must be able to meet this requirement:\nBe\nE\nthe set of environments for executing builds\nBe\nI\nset of inputs to the build\nBe\nO\nthe set of outputs of a build\nBe\nT\nthe set of time instants\nBe

repository creation\nChange of administrative settings at the group level\nCreation of new sub groups\nChange of settings you do not have permission to change\nplease ask to some who is currently energizing the\nInternal IT/Servizi Sviluppatori\nrole.\nif you do not know who is currently energizing the role please ask a question in the\nBigData/handbook\nTeams channel\nDevelopment model\nThe development cycle begins with the reception of a document containing the high-level design (HLD) provided by the\nArchitects\ncircle and the opening of a new gitlab repository that will serve as a container for all development activities.\nThe development model is iterative and based on the concept of sprint, that is a time unit within which all the steps of the project lifecycle are performed, with the aim of having light and fast release cycles and to reduce the presence of activities difficult to complete due to a time horizon too far away.\nConcentric system\nThe development system to be adopted is of a concentric nature and based on 3 levels of granularity, corresponding to increasing levels of decomposition of the project:\nHigh level design\nLow level design\nWork item\nthe decomposition of the project takes place through the creation of gitlab issues annotated with their level of granularity\nIssues at the same level of granularity are grouped in milestones, so we will have three types of milestones:\nHigh level design milestone\nLow level design milestone\nSprint milestone\nMilestones are concentric, a low level design milestone is composed of one or more sprints, a high level design milestone is composed of one or more low level design milestones, this type of organization allows you to update information at a higher level of abstraction based on the outputs and knowledge acquired during the course of the milestones of lower level.\nIssues\nThe reference tool for tracking and managing developments is gitlab issues, issues should as far as possible be structured according to the\nINVEST\nmodel\nIndependent\nThe issue should be autonomous, so that there is no inherent dependence on another issue.\nOne of the features of Agile Methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban or XP is the ability to move issues, taking into account their relative priority. If you find strictly dependent issues, a good idea would be to combine them into a single issue.\nNegotiable\nIssues are not explicit contracts and should leave room for discussion.\nThe only thing that is fixed in an agile project is the backlog (and even then, this can be clarified).\nWhile the issue is in the backlog, it can be rewritten or even discarded, depending on the business needs, the market, the technical requirements or any other type of request from the team members.\n[!Warning] The issue is negotiable while it is in the backlog, when an issue is planned to be executed in a milestone the team has already committed to implement it as described, if there is still uncertainty about what to do when executing a planned issue, the team during the retrospective meeting should discuss about how to improve the planning process\nValuable\nIssues must add value for stakeholders.\nThe main objective is to provide stakeholders with real project value. Inventing technical issues that do not bring value to stakeholders violates one of the principles of agile methodologies, which is to continuously provide software with value.\nEstimable\nYou always have to be able to estimate the size of an issue.\nIf the size of an issue cannot be estimated, it will never be planned or commissioned; in this way, it will never become part of a sprint. Therefore, it makes no sense to keep this type of issue in the backlog. Most of the time, the estimate cannot be made due to the lack of supporting information in the description of the issue itself, so it must be iterated on the description of the issue in order to clarify these doubts.\nSmall\nIssues should not be so large that they become impossible to plan/prioritise with the right level of confidence.\nTry to keep the size of the issues around a few person-days and at most a few person-weeks (a good rule of thumb is that every single backlog issue does not require more than 50% of a sprint; for example, a single issue will not require more than 5 days for a 2 week / 10 day sprint). Anything that goes beyond this range should be considered too big to be estimated with a good level of security.\nIssues that do not fit in the \"small\" definition can be called \"Epic\", where an epic will last more than one sprint and, necessarily, will have to be divided into smaller issues that can fit comfortably within a sprint. There is no problem in starting with issues in the form of epics, provided they are split when the time to plan them in a sprint approaches.\nTestable\nThe issue or its description shall provide the information necessary to enable the development of the tests.\nAn issue should only be considered completed if it has been successfully tested. If the result of an issue cannot be tested due to lack of information (see \"Estimable\" above), the discussion should not be considered planned in a sprint. This is particularly true for teams using TDD - Test Driven Development.\nLabels\nOn gitlab it is necessary to organize the issues through the use of labels, in order to make it possible to create custom views on issues with a certain meaning.\nThe format of the labels is\nnamespace:name\n.\nNamespaces\nGranularity\nThe granularity namespace collects the labels that identify the design level of an issue or its direct implementability\ngranularity:high-level-design\nThe issue noted with this label represents a high-level design element, something that needs to be discussed at system or architectural level, captures business requirements.\ngranularity:low-level-design\nThe issue noted with this label represents an element of low level design, a way of clarifying ideas well at the implementation level before starting to develop, in this type of issue decisions will have to be made such as:\nStandardization of resource nomenclature conventions\nPath on hdfs\nTables on database\nAPI Layout\nFormat of requests/replies\nRequired fields\ngranularity:work-item\nThe issue noted with this label represents an implementable and self-contained element, the developer must be able to complete the work described in an issue of this type within a single sprint.\nVerb\nThe verb captures in a single word what the assignee of an issue is expected to do for the issue to be declared concluded.\nAssigning a verb to an issue also represents the willingness to give the assignee the opportunity to have full power to deal with the issue as he sees fit.\nverb:act\nThe assignee of the issue must act, implement, carry out an action himself\nExamples\nImplement reading from json files\nUpdates the documentation\nConfigure the datanode heap\nverb:communicate\nThe assignee must communicate with a third party, with another team, with another company, so that the subject of the issue is declared concluded.\nExamples\nNotify Mario Rossi of the results of the tests\nInforms the customer of the status of developments\nAsk the circle of architects for confirmation of the decision made regarding hdfs\nverb:decide\nThe assignee is responsible for deciding something without having to seek consent\nExamples\nDecide which technology to use\nDecide if you want to continue with pair programming\nverb:think\nThe assignee must think of a solution to a problem by reporting it on the issue\nExamples\nFind a way to make a persistent connection through a firewall\nPros and cons of mqtt usage\nverb:understand\nThe assignee must understand a technology, a system, a requirement\nExamples\nUnderstand if kafka suits us\nUnderstand if the system does work properly\nUnderstand if the requirement has been implemented correctly\nKind\nRepresents the type of issue\nkind:feature\nThe issue represents a functionality to be implemented\nExamples\nImplement reading from json files\nUpdates the documentation\nConfigure the datanode heap\nkind:hotfix\nIt's a bug to be fixed\nExamples\nJson files are not written correctly\nThe configuration is not loaded correctly\nkind:meeting\nRepresents the agenda of a meeting\nExemptions\nPlanning meeting\nReview meeting\nRetrospective meeting\nPhase\nRepresents the progress of an issue\nphase:in-progress\nThe issue is currently being processed\nphase:blocked\nThe issue was in progress but due to an unexpected hiccup it is not possible to continue with the work.\nThis makes it clear to the team that something has jammed, this phase should not be used to model\nprecedence but only to signal that the normal process of development is not working\nphase:reviewing\nThe processing of the issue has been completed, it is possible for the maintainer to proceed to the code review and merge of the developments\nNamespaces and custom labels\nIt is always possible to create custom namespaces.\nYou can create custom labels within all namespaces.\nMilestones\nType of Milestone\nType issue\nDuration\nExamples\nDescription\nHigh Level Design\ngranularity:high-level-design\nFollows the project delivery milestones\nPOC, Minimum Viable Product, Industrialisation\nDesign level marker, captures business needs\nLow Level Design\ngranularity:low-level-design\nFraction of the duration of the HLD milestone\nLow level design iteration 0, Low level design iteration 1\nConceptual type milestones,   \n        represents a way of decomposing\n        the high level requirements in   \n        more granular issues, this type of \n        of issues capture technical decisions which do not involve\n        writing code, for example:\nPath on HDFS\nTables naming convention\nKafka topic structure\nTechnologies\nSprint\ngranularity:work-item\nFraction of the duration of the LLD milestone\nSprint 0, Sprint 1\nOperational milestone, collects clear and self-contained elements, an issue for each feature\nMilestone Events\nEvent\nDescription\nDuration\nPlanning\nThe team reviews the list of non-milestone issues for the reference granularity level and reaches a consensus on what can be achieved by the team within the milestone time horizon, the planning of a milestone can influence the content of the milestone at the highest level so as to integrate any\n    input resulting from a higher degree of awareness achieved thanks to work carried out at a lower level of abstraction\n2h for each week of milestone duration\nReview\nThe team reviews what has actually been achieved within the milestone, and what could not be achieved within the milestone is transported to the next milestone for the same level of granularity.\nThe team makes a demo to involve all the actors involved and keep them informed of the state of maturity of the work, this allows those who do not actively participate in the development of the project but are only interested in the output (stakeholders) to be able to influence the direction of the project in an iterative manner.\nThe review may result in new issues to be planned\n1h per week of sprint duration\nRetrospective\nThe team discusses the way they work, for example:\nHow did we deal with the milestone?\nAre there known critical points ?\nIs it necessary to reach consensus within the team on a specific practice?\nIs it necessary to acquire new skills and/or add resources to the team?\nThe retrospective event must also have the function of reporting feedback on the development methodology, so as to evolve this document of guidelines\n      to capture all good practices that have emerged during teamwork and to remove any obstacles that may have been encountered.\n1h per week of sprint duration\n[!Note] If the events of more than one level fall at the same time, their duration is not summed but a single event is carried out in order to absorb the fixed costs related to the meetings (check-in, call, agenda, minutes...).\n[!Danger] All meeting should have as an output a report, this report can be drafted in the gitlab issue associated to the meeting and than committed to the repository as a markdown file\nHigh level design and Milestone Projects\nInput\nIntermediate products\nOutput\nReview\nHigh level

decomposition into components of the software system to be implemented, these issues must be noted with the label\ngranularity:low-level-design\n, low level design issues are considered concluded when all work-items associated with low level design issues have been concluded.\nWork item and Development Sprint\nInput\nIntermediate products\nOutput\nReview\nIssues that can be implemented\nissue with granularity:work-item\nSoftware\nRetrospective meeting actions.\nsnapshot versions\nNew issues with granularity:work-item\nNew issues with granularity:low-level-design\nCarried out at the end of each low level design milestone\nA work item is a self-contained element that can be implemented  on which to act, a commitment that can be supported by a developer independently within a sprint, this promotes the creation of issues actually achievable without loss of focus with respect to the goal, if the issue once passed to implementation is too laborious for the length of the sprint or not easy to understand the developer himself provide to rework the issue scope decomposing it into further issues. This iterative approach leads to convergence towards a well-structured feature backlog.\nThe work items resulting from the decomposition of low level design must be noted with the label\ngranularity:work-item\n, to distinguish work items of different nature you can use the labels in the namespace\nkind:\nfor example\nkind:feature\n,\nkind:hotfix\n.\nRelease\nEach milestone will be mapped to a release, the milestone can be external or internal, an internal milestone involves an internal release, an internal demo or simply a check on the progress of the project, an external milestone involves an external release and then the creation of all the formal deliverables required by the project.\nMode of execution of the development sprint\nEach developer proceeds to extract a feature for the current milestone from the planned milestone on gitlab, from here begins the life cycle of a feature, the following activities are concurrent, they are not carried out in the order in which they are presented in the document and can proceed in parallel.\nElaboration of gitlab issue representing the feature with details on the implementation, useful resources, links to internal and/or external documentation, links to other repositories, literature\nFeature implementation\nUnit test implementation\nIntegration implementation test\nFeature documentation\nAt the end of the implementation, the developer will indicate that the feature is ready to be integrated, this will be done by opening a merge request. One or more developers (other than the one who implemented the feature) will review the implementation.\nThe primary goal of code reviews is to keep the quality of the code above a wanted standard and avoid bugs. Other (usually underestimated) goals of practicing code review are:\ncode and knowledge sharing\nview the problem from a different perspective\nmentoring, both for the reviewer and the author\nteam code ownership, the reviewer is owner as much as the author\nCode Review is not a gate keeping moment. Senior and Junior developers both need code review (no one is infallible) and no one will ever be in a position where feedback is not valuable.\nNo one should\never\naccept \"code\" which he does not understand. If something is not clear, ask clarification, even if it might be due to a lack of knowledge from your side (doing some research beforehand is encorauged though, but just because reading is faster than talking/writing not because we don't want to bother our colleagues). In this way you will clear the doubt and make you more proficient in the future in that scenario.\n[!Note] Google opensourced internal code review guidelines, we want to use those as if they where internally created in AgileLab because we found them reasonable and complete, please refer to the github hosted\nGoogle code review guidelines\nand substitute mentally\nCL\nwith\nMerge Request\nThe following properties should be verified:\nStyle\nAdherence to style rules\nAdherence to design patterns\nPresence of known bugs\nConsistency with the software project\nEffectiveness\nAdequacy of implementation\nMaintainability\nSuitability of the unit tests and their coverage\nAdequacy of integration tests\nAdequacy of documentation\nThe auditor will either approve the integration or ask the developer to make changes.\nA guideline that can be adopted by the reviewer is to ask the following questions:\nStyle\nIf this code was a chapter of a book would it seem written by a different author than the other chapters?\nIf this code was a chapter of a book would it adopt narrative devices consistent with the rest of the chapters?\nIf this code was a chapter of a book would it contain spelling mistakes?\nEffectiveness\nIf this code was a screwdriver would it be able to tighten the type of screw for which it was designed?\nMaintainability\nIf i would have to maintain this project would I trust the test suite?\nIf i would have to maintain this project would I be confident that a change of mine would have no side effects on the operation of the system?\nIf it were me to maintain this project would I be confident that updating one of its components would not have side effects on the operation of the system?\nIf i would have to maintain this project would I have the information necessary to carry out an arbitrary task?\nBefore the expiry of a milestone all the features to be implemented will have been integrated, the responsibility for preparing the release will fall to a developer who will be release manager for that release, this role will be carried out in turn (with the aim of making everyone equally able to manage the entire lifecycle of the project).\nBranching model\nMaster branch\nThis is the main branch; it is always synchronized with the latest release.\nThe content of this branch is subject to all the mechanisms of code review and quality control during integration.\nThe software artifact obtained by compiling this branch is still to be considered a\nSNAPSHOT\nas it does not correspond to any formal release.\nFeature branches\nFeature branches are short term development branches, usually assigned to a developer and representing an atomic unit of code review and integration within the\nmaster\nbranch.\nBranch\nfeature\nmust adhere to the following\nfeature/${issue-number}-{$description}\nnaming convention\nThe software artifact obtained by compiling the code present in a feature branch is to be considered a\nSNAPSHOT\nuseful to verify the proper functioning of the development unit\nWhen developments are finished on a feature branch it is ready to be integrated with the\nmaster\n.\nRelease branches\nThe\nrelease branches\ntrack releases.\nA new\nrelease branch\nis created when all\nfeature branches\nrequired for a release have been integrated into the\nmaster\nbranch and a new release must be made.\nTo support the\nbackport\nof features to an already released version it is possible to integrate the\nfeature branch\nalso with a\nrelease branch\nor proceed to the\ncherry-picking\nof the content of the\nfeature branch\nin the\nrelease branch\n.\nRelease branches must adhere to the following nomenclature\nrelease/v${major}.{minor}\nThe artifact obtained from the compilation of the release branch is still to be considered a snapshot because a release branch may be subject to backport of new features or bug fixing\nHotfix branches\nThe\nhoftfix branches\nare designed for fast and/or urgent fixes.\nThe\nhotfix branches\nare branched from the release on which they are to be made and are integrated directly on the same release, if the fix is also necessary on further releases and / or master the hotfix is cherry picked.\nHotfix branches must adhere to the following nomenclature\nhotfix/${issue-number}-{issue-description}\nTags\nTags uniquely and immutably identify a precise commit that defines the content of a software release.\nTags must adhere to the following nomenclature\nv${major}.${minor}.${patch}\nThe artifact obtained from the compilation of a tag is considered stable, its content is well defined and traceable and its version corresponds to the name of the tag.\nRebase Squash and Merge\nAgileLab employs a git workflow based on rebase, squash and fast forward merges, we want to keep the history linear and avoid excessive branching, we want a git log that is feature centric, intermediate states (like WIP commits) where code is in a not buildable state are often noisy and lead developers not to consider the git log as a useful source of info.\nTo correctly comply with the git repository management guidelines, when implementing an issue with\ngranularity:work-item\n, follow either\nUsing Agile.Gitlab.Cli\nor\nDirectly with Git and GitLab\nUsing Agile.Gitlab.Cli\n[!Note] This section assumes that you already have a cloned repository and that the remote repository has been initialized with the Agile.Gitlab.Cli rules\n[!Warning] If you are working on a repository with shared runners (e.g.\n/PublicAgileFactory/handbook\n) and you push any commit to it the continuous integration pipelines will not trigger unless your account has been\nvalidated by Gitlab\n.

    "text": "Software development goals\nAs developers, we must set ourselves these objectives when dealing with the development of a software system.\nCodebase\nA single codebase from which to deploy separately.\nTest\nThe unit tests must not be left out at all, they are fundamental for the success of the project because\nmake the developer able to perform  refactor necessary to improve the quality of the code, implement new usecase, or improve dependability of the software without fear of breaking something.\nWe provide test datasets, \"Golden\" datasets and/or data generators, we maintain these assets with the same\nimportance with which we develop the code, this will allow us to act without fear of introducing regressions.\nWe plan integration tests with external services in addition to the unit tests.\nLet's use continuous integration systems in order to capture as soon as possible regressions and / or bugs, we maintain\nthe continuos integration system as if it were the very application we are developing.\nDependencies\nAll dependencies (libraries, infrastructures, services) must be declared explicitly and appropriately isolated,\nThis is to simplify as much as possible the mental model that we build of the distributed system that we are implementing.\nMaking this mental model simple leads us to think in a more reliable way about the behavior of the system and\nto have better control over it throughout the project.\nConfigurations\nThe runtime configurations of our application must be managed with particular care, the system\nconfiguration must be homogeneous and operation friendly, as developers we must always place ourselves in the perspective of\nwhoever is managing the system, let's always consider ourselves the user of the configuration system, but let's not trust ourselves\nand our internal knowledge of the system, create a simple, consistent and reproducible configuration mechanism.\nExternal services\nLet's consider external services as resources connected to a server, let's correctly define their interactions, let's foresee their\nmultiplicity and/or unavailability.\nBuild, release, run\nWe clearly separate the steps of compilation, release and execution, the system must be compileable without having access to\nthe final system where it will run, the artifacts produced by the compilation must be reproducible.\nThe release must correctly mark the artifacts as released and the software supply chain must be traceable.\nProcesses\nConsider the software composed of a series of stateless processes, that outsource their state\non a persistence system with the appropriate strategy (event sourcing, write ahead logs, databases, etc ...)\nThis allows us to gain in robustness and compartmentalization of failure.\nPort binding\nLet's make it clear ports  are used  by the system we are building, let's plan their use correctly and document their function.\nConcurrency\nWe make our system capable of scaling horizontally across multiple processes from the very beginning.\nAvailability\nWe maximize the robustness of the system we are developing by planning acceptable start-up times graceful shutdown mechanism, it will be difficult to guarantee these properties if not foreseen from the beginning.\nEquality between environments\nWe make the software system aware of the environment in which it runs (dev, test, prod) but we consider as much as possible the environments as equal.\nWe make sure we specialize the environments as little as possible.\nLogs\nWe consider logs as event streams, we carefully plan what to log at what level in order to facilitate operations, monitoring, debugging and the discovery of useful information from log analysis.\nAdministration processes\nWe design and make available webapps and/or command line interfaces that allow us to interact with the system in an easy and operations friendly way.\nMonitoring and metrics\nWe make the system ready for operations from its conception, we export metrics, monitoring, and health checks with the aim of making our system observable, Starting a process and then wonder if it has really done everything you expect is not acceptable.\nDocumentation\nWe create clear documentation for our system that is capable of:\nEncourage on-boarding of new team members\nMake it clear to system operators what to do and how to best manage the system\nMake it clear to users how to interact with the system\n[!Warning] Documentation has a cost, which kind of documentation has to be produced should be agreed with the customer during sale, proof of concept project often produce only the minimum level of internal documentation required.\nCode Review\nWe develop our system through a clear flow based on the concept of code review, we integrate the features in the release only after making a process of Merge Request and a review.\nWe encourage the growth of other team members by conducting Pair Programming sessions.\nProgramming languages\nJava as first choice for enterprise or data intensive applications\nPython as first choice for data science applications\nTypescript for frontend\nScala has been deprecated, so we leverage it only for maintenance of existing code base or if the customer explicitely request it.\nThe use of other programming languages should be discussed with the architects, \nfor example the use of python for the development of a back-end.\nBest practices\nCode formatting\nCode formatting is essential to reduce merge conflicts.\nThere are some conflicts that have no legitimate reason to occur, including: mixed line endings (CR, CR+LF, LF), different indentation styles, variable code formatting conventions, and general code reformatting as part of an unrelated job.\nSource control tools and IDEs can and must be configured consistently across all contributors to avoid conflicts. Wherever the tools support it, formatting style configurations must be included in the repository. This facilitates sharing and ensures consistency. Many modern tools support separate configuration at the project and user levels, thus supporting customization while having a shared configuration.\nIf there is no shared coding style, it is necessary to disable automatic formatting within the development environment.\nTo support the developer in ensuring the consistency of formatting within the project you can use tools to be integrated into the build process, for example in java you can verify the adherence of the formatting to the shared style through checkstyle.\nFor Scala we suggest to use\nscalafmt\nwhich can be easily configured placing a\n.scalafmt\nfile in the root directory of the project: Intellij and visual studio code automatically ask you if you want to use the scalafmt configuration to format your code. An example of scalafmt configuration that we like a lot is\navailable here\n.\nFor formatting Java code there a lot of alternatives, we found particularly easy to setup and use\nspotless\n. It supports various languages and for each of them various code formatting tools. We used it proficiently through a maven with the following configuration (placed under\nproject.build.plugins\n):\n<\nplugin\n>\n<\ngroupId\n>\ncom.diffplug.spotless\n</\ngroupId\n>\n<\nartifactId\n>\nspotless-maven-plugin\n</\nartifactId\n>\n<\nversion\n>\n${spotless.version}\n</\nversion\n>\n<\nconfiguration\n>\n<!-- optional: limit format enforcement to just the files changed by this feature branch -->\n<\nratchetFrom\n>\norigin/master\n</\nratchetFrom\n>\n<\nformats\n>\n<!-- you can define as many formats as you want, each is independent -->\n<\nformat\n>\n<!-- define the files to apply to -->\n<\nincludes\n>\n<\ninclude\n>\n*.md\n</\ninclude\n>\n<\ninclude\n>\n.gitignore\n</\ninclude\n>\n</\nincludes\n>\n<!-- define the steps to apply to those files -->\n<\ntrimTrailingWhitespace\n/>\n<\nendWithNewline\n/>\n<\nindent\n>\n<\ntabs\n>\ntrue\n</\ntabs\n>\n<\nspacesPerTab\n>\n4\n</\nspacesPerTab\n>\n</\nindent\n>\n</\nformat\n>\n</\nformats\n>\n<!-- define a language-specific format -->\n<\njava\n>\n<!-- no need to specify files, inferred automatically, but you can if you want -->\n<!-- apply a specific flavor of google-java-format -->\n<\ngoogleJavaFormat\n>\n<\nversion\n>\n1.7\n</\nversion\n>\n<\nstyle\n>\nGOOGLE\n</\nstyle\n>\n</\ngoogleJavaFormat\n>\n<!-- make sure every file has the following copyright header. optionally, Spotless can set copyright years by digging through git history (see \"license\" section below) -->\n<\nlicenseHeader\n>\n<\ncontent\n>\n/* (C)$YEAR */\n</\ncontent\n>\n<!-- or <file>${basedir}/license-header</file> -->\n</\nlicenseHeader\n>\n</\njava\n>\n</\nconfiguration\n>\n</\nplugin\n>\nRemember that these are only suggestions and you must ensure they fit your project specific standards. If you see something that you do not like, propose a change!\nScala best practices\nScala is a very complex language with a lot of features... too many in some cases!\nOur Software Mentors\nhave gone through a lot of mistakes and have seen too many horrible things happen, take advantage of them when you are approaching a challenging design solutions: they can help you to find the right way of doing the thing, or at least, make you avoid some of Scala pitfalls and unsound features.\nA part from relying on Software mentors we kindly suggest you to read the following\nlist of best practices\nthat will avoid you a lot of headhaces\n.\nEven if Scala gives you too much freedom, scalac can be your friend: it comes with a lot of arguments that let you catch at compile time most errors. It can also help you to avoid using controversial or too advanced features without realizing it.

to extend a class which has some abstract deprecated methods (from an external dependency). If you are on Scala 2.11 you should use the fantastic\nsilencer plugin\nthat will let you silence warnings in very limited parts of your codebase. If you are lucky enough to be working on Scala 2.12.13 you can instead resort to the built-in\n@nowarn annotation\n.\nDocumentation\nreference\n[!Warning] Documentation has a cost, which kind of documentation has to be produced should be agreed with the customer during sale, proof of concept project often produce only the minimum level of internal documentation required\nWhy should I worry about the documentation\nIn simple terms, documentation helps people to do what they have to do.\nDocumentation helps users and teams:\nConsume less mental energy, work with adequate effort, preserving resources for more important tasks\nMinimize workload, onboarding of new team members takes place quickly and efficiently, they can start working right away.\nImprove your corporate brand, make it clear how you treat your external customers and internal employees by demonstrating support and help.\nWhat is documentation?\nDocumentation is all you think it is: a set of documents. A compass for the end user. A point of reference for the software engineer in you. In a more technical space, documentation is usually text or illustrations that accompany a piece of software. These documents serve as a guide, explaining how a system works, how it acts and how to use it. Teams can refer to the documentation when talking about product requirements, release notes or design specifications. Technical teams can use the documents to detail the code, APIs and register their software development processes.\nExternally, documentation often takes the form of manuals and user guides for system administrators, support teams and other end users.\nAll documentation should aim to achieve two main objectives:\nInforming Users\nEnable users to successfully accomplish something\nTypes of documentation\nTeam documentation\nTeam documentation helps to clarify the work that is being done so that teams can work as a team. These documents come in the form of project plans, team schedules, status reports, meeting notes and anything else a team might need to work functionally and efficiently. This type of documentation is detailed, ensuring that everyone stays in sync during the execution of a project.\nProject documentation\nThe project documentation is, of course, project-specific and provides the necessary structure for product development. It includes proposals, product requirements documents, design guidelines or sketches, roadmaps and other relevant information needed for development, with contributions from project managers, engineers and all other participating actors.\nSystem documentation\nThe system documentation contains information about code, APIs and other processes that allow developers to understand how to interact with the software, as well as limitations and requirements. Code snippets, such as REST request and response examples, are critical to this type of documentation.\n[!Note] System documentation should always include a thorough description of how to configure the system, document all configuration keys with their meaning and type.\nEnd User Documentation\nUser documentation is often the most visible type of documentation. It should be easy to read and understand, and updated with each new version of the software. It takes shape in \"Read Me\" documents, installation guides, administration guides and tutorials.\nChoice of documentation to be produced\nThe documentation to be produced is specific to the project being carried out, it is necessary to reach consensus as a team on what should be documented and how, we should never neglect the needs of the customer regarding the documentation, if the customer does not give us adequate information about it is our responsibility to anticipate the requests by asking the customer to explain clearly what is expected, so as not to find ourselves having to produce quickly a type of document never seen before.\nHow to create the documentation\nThe documentation must be managed like any software artifact, better if versioned within the repository containing the source code, producing the documentation in markdown is a good starting point, if the customer asks us for documents in a specific format we can manage them by generating them from the markdown in the repository, this allows us to version the documentation with the code. If generating the documentation in this way is impractical, we can manage the documents in their native format but still commit them within the repository, thus recording their relevance to a specific state of progress of the software.\nTake inspiration from this document and how the versions are managed.\nTest driven development\nTest-driven development (abbreviated as TDD) is a software development model based on the principle that automatic tests  are created before  the software that must be tested, and that the development of the  software is oriented exclusively to the goal of passing the automatic tests previously prepared.\nMore in detail, the TDD is based on the repetition of a short development cycle in three phases, called \"TDD cycle\". In the first phase (called \"red phase\"), the programmer writes an automatic test for the new function to be developed, which must fail because the function has not yet been implemented. In the second phase (called \"green phase\"), the programmer develops the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test. In the third phase (called the \"grey phase\" or refactoring phase), the programmer refactors the code to adapt it to certain quality standards.\nRed phase\nIn the TDD, the development of a new feature always begins with the creation of an automatic test to validate it. Since the implementation does not yet exist, the creation of the test is a creative activity, as the programmer must establish in what form the functionality will be exposed by the software and understand and define the details.\nThis approach leads to the definition of more consistent and robust interfaces as it forces the developer to put himself in the shoes of those who will use the functionality, be it a developer who programmatically invokes APIs or an end user.\nFor the test to be complete, it must be executable and, when executed, produce a negative result. In many contexts, this implies that a minimal \"stub\" of the code to be tested, necessary to ensure the compilability and executability of the test, must be made. Once the new test is complete and can be run, it should fail. The red phase ends when there is a new test that can be run and fails.\nGreen Phase\nIn the next step, the programmer must write the minimum amount of code required to pass the failed test. It is not required that the code written is of good quality, elegant, or general; the only explicit goal is for it to work, i.e. pass the test. In fact, it is explicitly forbidden by the practice of the TDD to develop parts of code not strictly aimed at passing the test that fails. When the code is ready, the programmer launches again all the tests available on the modified software (not just the one that previously failed). In this way, the programmer can immediately see if the new implementation has caused pre-existing tests to fail, i.e. has caused regressions in the code. The green phase ends when all tests are \"green\" (i.e. passed successfully).\nRefactoring\nWhen the software passes all the tests, the programmer spends a certain amount of time refactoring them, or improving their structure through a process based on small controlled changes aimed at eliminating or reducing objectively recognizable defects in the internal structure of the code. Typical examples of refactoring actions include choosing more expressive identifiers, eliminating duplicate code, simplifying and rationalizing the architecture of the source (e.g. in terms of its organization into classes), and so on. After each refactoring action, the automatic tests are performed again to ensure that the changes made have not introduced errors.\nAdvantages\nIf you write the tests before the code, you use the program before it is even created. It also ensures that the product code is individually testable. It is therefore mandatory to have a precise view of how the program will be used before it is even implemented. This avoids conceptual errors during implementation. In addition, the tests allow developers to have more confidence during the refactoring of the code, as they already know that the tests will work when required; therefore, they can afford to make radical changes in design, being certain that in the end they will get a program that will always behave the same way (being the tests always verified).\nThe use of Test Driven Development allows not only to build the program together with a series of automated regression tests, but also to estimate more accurately the progress of the development of a project.\nIf an object oriented approach is adopted, the creation of the test as a preliminary phase exhorts the developer to necessarily structure the code in such a way as to make it testable, this automatically leads to an increase in the cohesion of the classes and a decrease in their reciprocal coupling, since in order to be able to access the possibility of mocking dependencies on other classes and/or services it is necessary to isolate them clearly.\nContinuous Integration\nContinuous integration - the practice of frequently integrating new or modified code with the existing code repository - should take place with such a frequency that there is no window of intervention between commits and builds, and that no errors can arise without developers noticing and correcting them immediately. Builds are commonly triggered at each commit in a repository, instead of being scheduled periodically.\nContinuous integration is based on the following principles:\nMaintaining a code repository\nObviously, a version control system associated with the project is required. All the artifacts needed to build the project should be placed in the repository. The convention is that the system should be buildable from a new checkout and not require additional dependencies.\nAutomating the build\nA single command should have the ability to build the system. Build automation can also include deploying automation to development, testing and production environments. In many cases, the build system not only compiles binaries, but also generates documentation, web pages, statistics and artifacts for distribution (such as Debian DEB, Red Hat RPM, jar).\nAutomated testing\nOnce the code has been compiled, all tests should be run to confirm that the commit you are building from has not introduced any errors or regressions.\nKeeping the build fast\nThe build must be completed quickly, so that if an integration problem is identified quickly.\nContinuous integration in AgileLab\nThe reference tool for implementing continuos integration pipelines is Gitlab.\nIn gitlab you can configure your own builds to be executed within  docker container, it is therefore useful that each developer maintains container images oriented to the execution of reproducible and automated builds, within the project\ndeveloper/docker\nyou can maintain docker images (this can also be done at the level of individual projects) and use them later to make their own builds.\nGitlab CI example\nstages:\n-\ntest\n-\nbuild\nimage:\npython:2.7\ntest:\nstage:\ntest\nscript:\n-\npip\ninstall\n-r\nrequirements.txt\n-\npytest\nbuild-ubuntu-16.04:\nimage:\nname:\nregistry.gitlab.com/agilefactory/developers/agile-gitlab-cli/ubuntu-16.04:latest\nentrypoint:\n[\n\"\"\n]\nstage:\nbuild\nscript:\n-\n./build-local.sh\nartifacts:\npaths:\n-\ndist/lab-ubuntu-16.04\nbuild-ubuntu-18.04:\nimage:\nname:\nregistry.gitlab.com/agilefactory/developers/agile-gitlab-cli/ubuntu-18.04:latest\nentrypoint:\n[\n\"\"\n]\nstage:\nbuild\nscript:\n-\nbash\n./build-local.sh\nartifacts:\npaths:\n-\ndist/lab-ubuntu-18.04\nbuild-ubuntu-18.10:\nimage:\nname:\nregistry.gitlab.com/agilefactory/developers/agile-gitlab-cli/ubuntu-18.10:latest\nentrypoint:\n[\n\"\"\n]\nstage:\nbuild\nscript:\n-\nbash\n./build-local.sh\nartifacts:\npaths:\n-\ndist/lab-ubuntu-18.10\nbuild-archlinux:\nimage:\nname:\nregistry.gitlab.com/agilefactory/developers/agile-gitlab-cli/archlinux:latest\nentrypoint:\n[\n\"\"\n]\nstage:\nbuild\nscript:\n-\nbash\n./build-local.sh\nartifacts:\npaths:\n-\ndist/lab-archlinux\nLogging\nProperly managing logging is a primary objective in the development of a software system, objectives of the proper implementation of logging are:\nVerifiability\nObservability\nDebuggability\nA complex system is easier to manage if logging is done correctly and consistently.\nit is necessary to standardize logging levels, assigning a precise meaning to each logging level, as the developer implements logging must be subject to code review because consistency is fundamental in generating value rather than overhead in having a logging infrastructure.\nLogging levels\nSLF4J defines five levels of message recording, from TRACE to ERROR. The guidelines for their use are very vague.\nNote that all events with an INFO or higher level have a contract similar to the system API from an integration point of view: if they change, third party systems (e.g. monitoring systems) may need to be updated to work properly with the new system release. For these levels of logs, as far as possible system-internal jargon (references to the programming language, variable names) should be avoided as the target audience are end-users and system operators.\nERROR\nThis level serves as a general tool for errors. It should be used whenever the software encounters an unexpected error that prevents further processing. The software component that reports this error may attempt recovery operations.\nExamples:\nUnrecoverable errors, OutOfMemoryError\nInconsistency of the internal state of the application with any external systems\nProcessing errors per request or work unit\nThe main targets are the monitoring systems and the system operators, as the reported events have an impact on the operational performance of the system.\nWARN\nThis level is associated with events indicating irregular circumstances, from which we have a clearly defined recovery strategy that has no impact on system availability or performance.\nA typical example of a candidate event is when a software component detects an inconsistency due to input data from external systems and takes corrective action to compensate for it.\nThe main audience for these events are automated systems, operators and administrators, as this level of messages indicates that the system is not functioning optimally or could herald future failure.\nINFO\nThis level is used for events that constitute important state changes within a software component (such as initialization, shutdown, persistent resource allocation, etc.) that are part of normal operations.\nEach software component should record at least four events at this level:\nwhen it enters the initialization phase\nWhen it becomes operational\nWhen the ordered shutdown starts\nShortly before ending normally\nThe main audience for these events are the operators and administrators, who use them to confirm that the main interactions (such as rebooting components) have occurred correctly within the system.\nDEBUG\nThis level is used by the developer to issue information of a strictly technical nature, such as intermediate processing results, it is useful to validate the proper functioning of the software under development.\nThis level of logs should not be active in production unless there is a specific need to diagnose a problem.\nTRACE\nThis level is used by the developer to obtain information at a very fine level, for example it is possible to log at this level all the parameters entering a function, the execution times of the methods and other information of a very fine nature.\nThis level of log should not be active in production unless specific needs in the diagnosis of a problem.\nStructured Logging\nA recurring problem with log files is that they are written in the form of unstructured text. This makes it difficult to query them for any kind of useful information. As a developer, it would be useful to have the ability to filter all logs of a certain number of customers or transactions. The objective of structured logging is to solve this type of problem and allow further analysis.\nFor log files to be machine-readable, they can be written in a structured format that can be easily analyzed, such as json.\nStructured logging can be used for different purposes:\nProcessing log files for analysis or business intelligence (A good example of this is processing logs of accesses to the web server)\nSearching for log files: Being able to search and correlate log messages is very important for development teams during the development process and for solving production problems.\nExample of structured logging:\n{\n\"pid\"\n:\n6253\n,\n\"level\"\n:\n\"INFO\"\n,\n\"time\"\n:\n\"2018-05-13T17:52:25.147+09:00\"\n,\n\"msg\"\n:\n\"User created article\"\n,\n\"user_id\"\n:\n123\n,\n\"article_id\"\n:\n45\n}\nLog aggregation\nEspecially in the development of distributed systems it is essential to provide a platform for the aggregation of application logs, it is not practical to have to manually retrieve logs from multiple machines and from multiple files with different formats, it is here that come into play a systems for log aggregation, ELK (Elasticsearch, logstash, kibana) is a de facto standard, developing by redirecting logs to one of these systems simplifies the diagnosis of any bugs and the collection of statistics.\nFor cloud ready applications it is a good idea to redirect the application logs to the reference service for the technology stack you are using in order to manage homogeneously the logs from all components of the application.\nFormatting strings in logs\nWhen emitting log lines you need to pay attention to how the strings to be logged are formatted, especially for very fine logging levels (debug, trace) because formatting strings for disabled logging levels becomes an expensive and useless operation, you need to use the idioms provided by the logging library you are using, for example with sfl4j you can use placeholders.\nString user =\n\"John\"\n;\nlog.info(\n\"Hello {}\"\n, user);\n// the \"Hello John\" string is formatted only if the info log level for the current logger is enabled\nor control explicitly if the log level is enabled\nString user =\n\"John\"\n;\nif\n(log.isInfoEnabled()){\n    log.info(\n\"Hello \"\n+ user);\n}\n// the \"Hello John\" string is formatted only if the info log level for the current logger is enabled\nin Scala it is possible to use\ncall-by-name\nparameters, a logging trait that exploits this language capability is available in the\nagile-commons\nlibrary.\nCorrelation ids\nIn multithreaded systems that process multiple requests at the same time it is usually difficult to reconstruct how the log messages are related to the processing of an input request, it is useful to assign an id to the input request to the system and to equip each log line with this id.\n2019-09-03 15:31:29.189  INFO [903c472a08e5cda0] COLLECTING CUSTOMER AND ADDRESS WITH ID 1 FROM UPSTREAM SERVICE\n2019-09-03 15:31:29.193  INFO [903c472a08e5cda0] GETTING CUSTOMER WITH ID 1\n2019-09-03 15:31:29.198  INFO [903c472a08e5cda0] GETTING ADDRESS FOR CUSTOMER WITH ID 1\nMonitoring\nMonitoring is the process to gather metrics about the operations of an IT environment's hardware and software to ensure everything functions as expected to support applications and services.\nBasic monitoring is performed through device operation checks, while more advanced monitoring gives granular views on operational statuses, including average response times, number of application instances, error and request rates, CPU usage and application availability.\nMonitoring can rely on agents or be agentless. Agents are independent programs that install on the monitored device to collect data on hardware or software performance data and report it to a management server. Agentless monitoring uses existing communication protocols to emulate an agent, with many of the same functionalities.\nFor example, to monitor server usage, an IT admin installs an agent on the server. A management server receives that data from the agent and displays it to the user via the IT monitoring software interface, often as a graph of performance over time. If the server stops working as intended, the tool alerts the administrator, who can repair, update or replace the item until it meets the standard for operation.\nApplication level monitoring is one of the pillar of cloud ready applications, the application itself exposes structured data about its inner workings, this enables operators of the system to manage, observe and proactively inform the development team of issues, regressions and unexpected behaviors.\nOne of the leading application monitoring platforms at the moment is\nprometheus\n, there are libraries for all the main languages that are able to export application metrics in a\nprometheus\ncompatible format.\nAn example\nprometheus\nendpoint responds with info similar to these:\n# HELP hash_seconds Time taken to create hashes\n# TYPE hash_seconds histogram\nhash_seconds_bucket{code=\"200\",le=\"1\"} 2\nhash_seconds_bucket{code=\"200\",le=\"2.5\"} 2\nhash_seconds_bucket{code=\"200\",le=\"5\"} 2\nhash_seconds_bucket{code=\"200\",le=\"10\"} 2\nhash_seconds_bucket{code=\"200\",le=\"+Inf\"} 2\nhash_seconds_sum{code=\"200\"} 9.370800000000002e-05\nhash_seconds_count{code=\"200\"} 2\nBy collecting the reported data, dashboards and timeseries visualization can be built.\nSerialization and schema evolution\nSerialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer) or transmitted (for example, across a network connection link) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment). When the resulting series of bits is reread according to the serialization format, it can be used to create a semantically identical clone of the original object.\nSchema evolution is the term used for how the store behaves when schema of the serialized objects is changed after data has been written to the store using an older version of that schema. Many serialization formats (like java serialization) do not support schema evolution, if the class definition changes data stored with the older definition becomes unreadable, this is often unacceptable and should be mitigated by the usage of a serialization format supporting schema evolution and/or by structuring the application from the very beginning to address the \"schema evolution problem\".\nIn the bigdata ecosystem popular serialization format are:\nJava Serialization\nJson\nAvro\nThrift\nAlways prefer avro when designing big data applications for its compactness, bigdata tool support and for its clean schema evolution semantics.\n[!Note] AgileLab opensourced\nDarwin\nan avro schema registry on github, please check that project  documentation and use it pervasively any time you are using avro serialization, it is an important company asset and currently solves many pain point in working with binary serialized data while retaing the ability to evolve the schema\nBenchmarks\nA benchmark is the act of running a computer program, a set of programs, or other operations, in order to assess the relative performance of an object, normally by running a number of standard tests and trials against it.\nBenchmarking is usually associated with assessing performance of software, software benchmarks are, for example, run against compilers or database management systems (DBMS).\nBenchmarks provide a method of comparing the performance of various subsystems across different conditions.\nAgileLab has a culture of \"benchmark or it didn't happen\", do not start wars on \"immutable is slower than mutable\", \"java is slower than c\", we are going to waste time, if you want to assess the performance characteristic of code use a benchmarking framework and measure it objectively.\n[!Note] The developers gitlab group hosts a project related to\nmicrobenchmarks\nof code snippets, if you develop general microbenchmark please open a merge request there, the same concept can be used to develop project microbenchmarks inside the project repository, Enjoy!\nProfiling\nOften we need to diagnose where our software spends time in order to identify where is best to optimize to gain performance boosts, this is a time consuming and error prone process (in term of wasted hours optimizing a method for little gain) our effort should be guided by metrics collected with profiling tools.\nCpu profiling\nThe task of a profiler is to measure resources usage by a program (in our case, to measure CPU time consumption). In an ideal world results are not affected by a method of measurement used, but in reality they do. This is why several measurement approaches exist.\nA profiler needs to record what functions were invoked and how many times it took to execute a function. The simplest way of obtaining this data is sampling. When using this method, a profiler interrupts program execution at specified intervals and logs the state of program’s call stack. The problem with sampling is that even with hardware support it’s not 100% accurate. Some function calls can fall down through `holes’ of a sampling grid, and will not be seen in a profile. But this usually means that these functions are not worth optimizing—CPU spent very little time executing them. The great benefit of the sampling approach is that it almost doesn’t affect program execution, so it can be successfully used in production environment.\nInstrumentation is often considered as a more `precise’ approach to profiling. Doing an instrumentation means inserting a special code that performs calls counting or calculation of execution time into prologs and epilogs of functions. The problem with this approach is that it can seriously skew the results of profiling. Consider a function which takes just a dozen CPU cycles to execute and add another dozen of cycles due to instrumentation—now the instrumented function runs twice as long as the original version! And getting the current time is a system call which means that it will take a lot more CPU cycles to burn. That’s why some profilers (e.g. GNU gprof) usually instrument code only to record function’s call count—this is a relatively cheap operation, and measure function execution time using sampling. The other solution is to restrict instrumentation only to a selected subset of program’s functions.\nOptimize hot methods first to instantly improve performance of the software you are developing.\n[!Note] Use\nVisualVM\ncpu sampling or profiling each time you need to gain insights on what to optimize.\nMemory profiling\nWhen dealing with software running on the jvm we dread the infamous\nOutOfMemoryError\n, or the more destructive and heap dump inducing\nGC Overhead Limit Exceeded\n. We need tools to inspect the content of the heap and try to make sense of why the jvm garbage collector is not performing correctly its duty, it is fundamental to master heap profiling tool to be able to resolve this kind of errors.\n[!Note] Use\nVisualVM\nmemory sampling or profiling each time you need to gain insights on what is making your heap so difficult to manage\nTools\nBuild Tools\nLinguaggio\nTool\nScala\nMaven\nthe customer does not accept an SBT deliverable\nScala\nSBT\nthe customer accepts deliverable based on SBT\nJava\nMaven\nPython\nSetup tools\nTest Tools\nLinguaggio\nTool\nScala\nScalatest\nJava\nJunit\nPython\nUnittest\nApi Documentation Tools\nLinguaggio\nTool\nScala\nScaladoc\nJava\nJavadoc\nPython\nDocstrings\nStatic analysis tools\nhttps://github.com/mre/awesome-static-analysis\nLinguaggio\nTool\nScala\nscalastyle\nScala\nscalafmt\nScala\nscapegoat\nJava\nFindbugs\nJava\nCheckStyle\nJava\nSonarJava\nPython\npycodestyle"

    "level": "1.8.7",
    "text": "Software Design Guidelines\nThis section lists guidelines and best practices related to software design at any scale, from classes and methods up to monolithic or distributed applications.\nPackage design\nPremise: while Java and Scala have 'packages' as an explicit programming construct, you can generalize the following guidelines to other languages by applying them to 'folders', 'namespaces', or whatever construct that allows you to group files/classes.\nThe package structure of an application is a key factor in determining the maintainability and understandability of the codebase,\nand eventually in ensuring a good developer experience.\nPackages are not simply a way to group classes. They should be considered as units of encapsulation and important architectural constructs.\nAs such, they obey to the same principles of high-cohesion and low-coupling that apply to any scale in software.\nEven more important,\na package is a modelling construct\nand should be used to express the key concepts of the domain.\nGuidelines\nEach package should model a feature\nIn short, a feature is a concept. It can be a domain concept, such as:  an entity of domain, an operation or a whole use-case.\nEx.: user (entity), changePassword (use case), checkPasswordValidity (operation).\nWhile your primary concern should always be the modelling of business logic, since software is made up of infrastructure too, a feature can also be an infrastructure concept.\nEx.: ‘database.connection’, ‘http.server’.\nPrefer packaging by feature to packaging by type or by layer\nGrouping together classes that does not collaborate while simply share some technical aspect (i.e.: they have a common super-type or belong to the same architectural layer) is discouraged.\nEx.: having a ‘exceptions’ package is meaningless: exceptions’ are not a feature, but simply a programming construct.\nSimilarly,  in a MVC architecture you should avoid having ‘controllers’, ‘views’ and ‘models’ packages, since they are not features either.\nAlthough several frameworks suggest (or even mandate) this kind of organisation, it has several drawbacks, because it spreads all classes related to a single feature in distinct places. Moreover, such packages naturally become bigger over time, so this approach does not scale.\nA package should not necessarily match a single layer. A package should instead contain all classes related to a given feature.\nEx. a\nlogin\nor\nuser.login\npackage should contain UserController, User, LoginService, LoginResult, LoginException and so on.\nAs you can see, several classes having different types or belonging to different layers are put in the same package (Controller, Exception …) since they collaborate to realise the same feature.\nThis allows to easily detect, understand and modify that feature in one place.\nAt the same time you can maintain the layer separation at a class level (i.e. having distinct classes for Controller, Service etc…) to guaranteeing separation of concerns and testability.\nTry to avoid\ncommon\nor\nutils\npackages\nYou should avoid having a giant\ncommon\npackage containing all sort of classes such as DatesUtils, ParsingUtils etc.\nSuch a package does not convey any useful information.\nUse distinct feature-oriented packages instead, such as\nparsing\n,\ndate\n, that are more expressive.\nGroup features in package-groups\nAs the application grows it raises the need to group features to get a clear and organised architecture.\nTo this purpose you can group several related packages under one parent package, that we'll call a 'package-group'.\nA package-group does not represent a feature int itself, but just a way to group related features.\nEx.: create a\nuser\npackage-group that contains all user-related features such as\nuser.login\n,\nuser.changepassword\n,\nuser.logout\nsub-packages.\nMake packages cohesive and low coupled\nClasses that belongs to the same package should be tightly coupled: they are typically used together to perform some action,\ncannot be reused independently and tend to be modified together. This makes the package ‘cohesive’.\nWhen packages are highly cohesive they also tend to be low coupled (even if not always).\nA useful trick to raise cohesion:\nuse method signatures as a guide\nto find classes and types that work together.\nAlso consider to extract the common logic between two features in a separate feature.\nEx.: UserController, User, LoginService are collaborating classes that work together to perform a use case. \nSo you decide to put them in the package\nuser.login\n.\nNow suppose that LoginService has the following method: login(val credentials: Credentials): LoginResult;\nIn this case you should consider moving also Credentials and LoginResult in the\nuser.login\npackage (making it choesive).\nNow\nuser.login\nand\nuser.logout\ncan be independently developed (low coupled): each has its own controller, view and so on.\nHowever they share the User class, so you can decide to move it to the\nuser\npackage.\nCreate a root package and a config package\nThe suggested structure for your application is the following:\n.\n└── it.agilelab.myproject-group.myproject.app\n    ├── config\n    ├── features\n    ├── infrastructure\n    AppMain.class\nwhere\nconfig\ncontains all configuration related code, for dependency injection.\nconfig\ndepends on all other packages, while no package should depend on\nconfig\n.\nfeatures\nand\ninfrastructure\nare package-groups\nAppMain is a class containing the ‘main’"

    "text": "Internships\nDoing an internship in Agile Lab is an excellent opportunity for you to dive into real-world projects and develop the essential skills needed to thrive in the field of data engineering. You'll have the chance to contribute to meaningful projects while building up you knowledge on the latest tools, techniques, and methodologies that drive data-driven businesses, all while being mentored by experienced people. It is also a great chance to experience the way we work as a company.\nNo previous experience is required, just being smart and reliable. All internships are fully remote.\nProcess\nThe following process is meant to handle most cases. Since we're interacting with one (or more, in the case of double degrees) external entities and since not always internships are our first interaction with a candidate (say, part-time student employees who are starting a thesis and want to do it in the company) some things may not apply. Contact the\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Coordinator\nfor guidance in these scenarios.\nWhen handling an internship consider that it is a significant investment in time and resources for both the company and the candidate, and it has to work for all parties in order to be successful.\nPeople involved\nAs an overview of the people that are involved in this process, we have:\nThe candidate/intern\nRecruiting and Hiring/Recruiter\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Coordinator\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Tutor\nRecruiting and Hiring/University Link\nTutor (usually a professor) from the university\nAdministration department of the university\nAdministration department of Agile Lab\nInternship steps\nApplying\nThe process is started by you, the candidate; you can either:\nApply via your university's job placement board (or similar) in case you have found the internship project in there.\nContact our HR department via email: hr@agilelab.it .\nScreening Call\nThe\nRecruiting and Hiring/Recruiter\nconducts as Screening Call as per\nthe relevant section in the Hiring process\nIntroductory Call\nFollowing the positive outcome of the Screening Call, an Introductory Call is scheduled with the candidate and the\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Coordinator\nin order to introduce the projects and narrow down on one of them.\nDuring this call, the coordinator should investigate the following aspects:\nInterest of the candidate in the company and the fields it operates in.\nCandidate's interests and study curriculum.\nPractical experience in software development both from the study curriculum and outside of it.\nKind of internship: thesis or internship and whether it is part of a study curriculum or not.\nEffort for the internship: how many months and how many hours is it expected to last?\nTimelines: when can the internship start? By when does it have to be completed?\nIf the internship is connected to a study curriculum, whether a university tutor has already been selected.\nIn case a project was not already chosen, the available projects will then be outlined and a proper one will be selected together with the candidate according to:\nThe strategic priorities of the projects.\nThe time available for the project.\nThe candidate's skills and interests.\nThe relevance of the project to the candidate's curriculum.\nInternship Setup Call\nIf the Introductory Call went well, a\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Tutor\nwill be selected, and a final step before starting will be a joint call with the candidate, coordinator and tutor to ensure that the candidate is a good fit for the project. Starting a project if it does not fit the candidate is a bad idea as it wastes resources on the company side, and can severely impact the completion of the candidate's study curriculum.\nIf this step goes well, we can start to follow all the remaining steps needed to fulfill any contractual obligations or processes on the university side.\nHandling the process on the university side\nMost universities have some kind of process that the candidate, the company at which the internship takes place, and the tutor must follow for it to be considered valid.\nIn case the internship is tied to a study curriculum, the candidate should accurately review all the steps needed by their university in order to ensure that it is considered valid for their degree when it is completed.\nThe\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Tutor\nengages the appropriate\nRecruiting and Hiring/University Link\nto follow up on the university's process, especially if the application did not come through the university's job board, as we'll usually need to post the internship project there before it can be approved by the university.\nStarting the internship\nOnce everything is ready, inform the administration so that they can proceed with the internship contract.\nThe steps outlined in the\nOnboarding document\nshould then be followed as with any new hire. The tutor will act as the Buddy for the intern.\nThe intern will use their own devices for the internship; to access the company's resources, they must configure them according to company policies.\nIf the chosen project is the last one for a research area, the\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Coordinator\nevaluates with the\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Lead Link\nand\nThought Leadership and Innovation/CTO\nif the research theme can be considered complete. If so, communicate this to the\nRecruiting and Hiring/University Link\nso they can update the internship projects on the various universities job boards accordingly.\nWorking on the internship project\nIt is now time to start working on that cool project, and create some amazing things. To help ensure a productive internship, make sure that these steps are followed:\nThe\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Tutor\nmust setup periodic update meeting with the intern, as well as the university tutor.\nThe\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Tutor\nshould help and mentor the intern on technical aspects, and assist with interacting with other company roles (such as interacting with Internal IT when setting up a development environment on a cloud provider).\nThe\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Tutor\nshould periodically update the the\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Coordinator\non how the internship is going and if there are any issues.\nAt the end of the internship, the\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Tutor\ncommunicates the outcome to the\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Coordinator\n.\nHiring at the end of an internship\nAt the end of the internship the\nThought Leadership and Innovation/Thesis & Internship Tutor\nwill provide feedback on the candidate. If everything went well, the process continues from the\nTechnical Interview\nstep  as per\nthe relevant section in the Hiring process\n."

    "text": "Context\nBeing a fast evolving and growing company, we periodically need to refine career paths to better align them to the market, what the company needs to achieve and how our employees want to professionally grow. Roles, Ladder levels, people need to adapt to a\nVUCA\nenvironment, but in Agile Lab we react fast and effectively when we detect disconnection.\nWe are a company deeply based on people, and we have the ambition and mission to elevate the game in data, and we truly believe we can make the difference. We cannot make it without extraordinary people, highly impacting the market, the customers, and our people internally. These people are the staff engineers, those professionals with incredible high technical knowledge and skills, capable of solving intricate problems, influence customers and internal teams, in more simple words:\nmaking the difference between us and the others\nAgileLab Staff Engineer Manifesto\nOwn the craft. Shape the market. Grow the people.\nOutcome‑driven, not ticket‑driven\nWe start every initiative by clarifying the impact we want for clients or for AgileLab, an OKR, a learning goal, a metric. Architecture, code and processes follow that North Star.\nStrategy → Execution bridge\nStaff Engineers translate Tech Strategy into actionable blueprints, POCs and enablement material. We run short, high‑leverage spikes that prove value fast (e.g., Spark‑replacement engines, GenAI agent demo, cost‑cutting Kafka alternatives) and hand teams a ready playbook.\nComplexity radar & first‑responders\nWhen a project hits “the messy middle”, we embed just long enough to untangle the knot, level‑up the team and exit. Delivery stays a BU responsibility; we provide the catalytic push.\nGuardians of engineering time\nEngineering Office leadership owns the calendar and defends it; we show the ROI in prototypes shipped, talks given, practices codified.\nPractice builders & asset owners\nOur concrete deliverables:\nReference architectures and code templates reused across BUs.\nValue propositions that Sales can pitch tomorrow.\nReusable POCs that turn into client aha‑moments.\nKnowledge assets that close capability gaps and boost delivery confidence.\nThought leadership that positions us as a go-to partner in our domain.\nMentors who multiply talent\nWe rotate through teams, pair on code reviews, and coach emerging tech leads. A rising tide lifts all squads—and expands our own reach.\nThought leaders, inside and out\nWriting, speaking, contributions, evangelizing are planned projects, not after‑hours hobbies. Visibility fuels brand trust and personal growth; the Office allocates capacity accordingly.\nRight‑sized pre‑sales muscle\nStaff Engineers engage when a deal needs new storytelling or deep architecture credibility. Not for every credentials call. Once the offering is repeatable, BU leads take over.\nMeasurable, even when fuzzy\nFor every initiative we agree on a “hard enough” indicator delta, onboarding hours saved, blueprint adoption rate. If we can’t count it, we rethink it.\nSustainable passion\nWe love thorny problems, late‑night migrations and big‑bang demos, but only when balanced by health, learning and reflection. Burnout helps no‑one.\nCommitments\nAgileLab gives\nStaff Engineers give\nCapacity on the budget\nand\nin practice\nVisible impact on at least one cross‑BU initiative each quarter\nA seat in yearly strategy reviews\nContinuous feedback loops from market to strategy\nBudget & time for certs, conferences, etc.\nInternal → external thought‑leadership artefacts\nCareer ladder clarity & fair evaluation\nMentorship hours and documented best‑practices that outlive us\nHow we’ll know it works\nTeams resolve blockers faster, deploy safer.\nSales cycles shorten because our demos convince.\nEngineering blogs, talks and Git repos carry our logo.\nStaff Engineers log off proud—knowing their work safeguards AgileLab’s long‑term business sustainability and propels us confidently toward tomorrow.\nDesign the future. Make it real. Bring everyone along."

    "text": "We love to embrace the change and our organization is continuously evolving. In such dynamic context it is important to be aware about the most common team archetypes to not create dysfunctional organizations.\nIn such area we align with the theory coming from\nTeamTopologies\nthat we report here to be more effective (directly from the book, summarized and generalized).\nStream-Aligned Team\nA \"stream\" is the continuous flow of work aligned to a business domain or organizational capability. It requires clarity of purpose and responsibility so that multiple teams can coexist, each with their own flow of work.\nA stream-aligned team is a team\naligned to a single, valuable stream of work\n. The team is empowered to build and deliver customer or user value as quickly, safely, and independently as possible,\nwithout requiring hand-offs to other teams to perform part of the work\n. The stream-aligned team is the primary team type in an organization, and the purpose of the other fundamental team topologies is to reduce the burden on the stream-aligned teams.\nBecause a stream-aligned team works on the full spectrum of delivery, they are, by necessity, closer to the customer and able to quickly incorporate feedback from customers.\nIn a complex organization different streams can coexist: specific customer streams, business-area streams, geography streams, product streams, user-persona streams, or even compliance streams. A stream is a micro-enterprise within a large firm, with an independent focus and purpose.\nCapabilities within a Stream-Aligned Team\nDesign\nDelivery\nOperability\nMonitoring\nOwnership and management\nQuality assurance\nUser/Customer experience\nPrioritization\nExpected behaviors\nProduce a steady flow of change\nCorrect based on feedback\nConstantly learn and adapt\nMinimal ( ideally zero ) hand-offs of work to other teams\nHave time and space to address quality\nProactively and regularly reaches out the supporting fundamental-topologies teams\nStrive to achieve \"autonomy, mastery, and purpose\"\nEnabling Team\nHigh performing teams are continuously improving their capabilities in order to stay ahead. But how can a stream-aligned team with end to end ownership find the space for researching, reading about, learning, and practicing new skills ? Stream-aligned teams are under pressure to deliver and respond to change.\nAn enabling team is composed of specialists in a given domain, and they help bridge this capability gap. Such team cross-cut to the stream-aligned teams and have the required bandwidth to research, try out options, and make informed suggestions on tools, practices, frameworks, processes. This allows the stream-aligned team to acquire and evolve capabilities without having to invest the associated effort.\nEnabling teams have a strongly collaborative nature; they thrive to understand the problems and shortcomings of stream-aligned teams in order to provide effective guidance.\nEnabling teams actively avoid becoming \"ivory towers\" of knowledge, dictating technical choices for other teams to follow, while helping teams to understand and comply with organization-wide technology constrains. This akin to the idea of \"servant leadership\" but applied to team interactions rather than individuals.\nThe end goal is to increase the autonomy of stream-aligned teams by growing their capabilities with a focus on their problems first, not the solutions per se\n. If an enabling team does its job well, the team that is helping should no longer need the help from the enabling team after a few weeks or months; there should not be a permanent dependency on an enabling team.\nExpected behaviors\nproactively seeks to understand the needs of stream-aligned teams, establishing regular checkpoints and jointly agreeing when more collaboration is needed\nstay ahead of the curve in keeping abreast of new approaches, tooling and practices, well before the actual needs of stream-aligned teams\nact as a messenger of good and bad news related to the technology life cycle\noccasionally act as a proxy for external (or internal) services that are currently too difficult to be used directly\npromote learning across stream-aligned teams, acting as curator and facilitator for knowledge sharing\nEnabling team versus Communities of practice\nBoth enabling teams and communities of practice (CoP) can help to increase awareness and capabilities within other teams. The members of an enabling team work on enabling activities, whereas a CoP is more a diffuse grouping of interested individuals from across several teams, with an aim to share practices and improve working methods on a periodic basis.\nCoP create the right environment for social learning, experiential learning, and a rounded curriculum, leading to accelerated learning for members.\nEnabling teams and CoP can co-exist because they have slightly different purposes and dynamics: an enabling team is small, long-lived group of specialists focused on building awareness and capability for other teams at any point in time, whereas CoP usually seeks to have a more widespread effects, diffusing knowledge across many teams. Of course enabling teams can also have their own \"enabling-teams CoP\".\nComplicated-subsystem Teams\nA complicated-subsystem team is responsible for building and maintaining a part of the system that depends heavily on specialist knowledge, to the extent that most team members must be specialists in that area of knowledge in order to understand and make changes to the subsystem.\nThe goal of this team is to reduce the cognitive load of stream-aligned teams working on systems that include or use the complicated subsystem.\nA complicated subsystem team is created only when a subsystem needs mostly specialized knowledge. The decision is driven by the cognitive load, not by a perceived opportunity to share the component.\nPlatform Teams\nThe purpose of a platform team is to enable stream-aligned teams to deliver work with substantial autonomy. The stream-aligned team maintains full ownership of building, running, and fixing their domain.\nThe final goal of a good platform is to simplify the stream-aligned user's life and to reduce cognitive load.\nExpected behaviors\nuse strong collaboration with stream-aligned teams to understand their needs\nrely on fast prototyping techniques and involve stream-aligned members for fast feedback\nstrong focus on usability and reliability for their services\nlead by example, using the services they provide internally, partnering with stream-aligned teams and enabling teams.\nunderstand the adoption of new tools and technologies is not immediate, but instead evolve along the adoption curve\nTeams interaction modes\nThere are three fundamentals ways teams can collaborate:\nCollaboration: working closely together with another team\nX-as-a-service:  consuming or providing something with minimal collaboration\nFacilitating: helping (or being helped by) another team to clear impediments\nIn addition a team can use two different interactions modes. But there are implicit restrictions in the interactions modes that a team archetype can adopt.\nStream-Aligned\nCollaboration: typical\nX-as-a-service: typical\nFacilitating: occasional\nEnabling\nCollaboration: occasional\nX-as-a-service: -\nFacilitating: typical\nComplicated sub-system\nCollaboration: occasional\nX-as-a-service: typical\nFacilitating: -\nPlatform\nCollaboration: occasional\nX-as-a-service: typical\nFacilitating: -\nOur team organization\nMiro Board for Team Topologies in Engineering department"

    "text": "Product Development\nPurpose\nThe product development workflow ensures that all the new features are efficiently conceptualized, developed, and launched by following a structured process, aligning teams, and meeting customer needs and company goals.\nFeatures Planning\nFollowing the key processes highlighted in the\nProduct Management\nworkflow, the outcome of the Product Manager work is a backlog with prioritized items. The backlog is divided into experiences: for every area and/or user persona, the Product Manager defines the features that will be developed along with their priority.\nThe Delivery Team, composed of developers, designers, and testers, will then take the top items from the backlog and break them down into smaller tasks. These tasks will be estimated and planned. The team processes every item using the steps detailed in the\nProduct Software Development\nworkflow.\nIn addition to the features, the Delivery Team will also work on technical debt, bugs, and other maintenance tasks. These tasks are also prioritized and planned, but urgent bugs may be addressed immediately. If the bugs are related to customer tickets, the Customer Support team will be involved in the process as described in the\nCustomer Support\nworkflow.\nOnce all the items are listed and prioritized, the Project Lead updates the issues backlog accordingly, and starts a new development cycle.\nDelivery Cycle\nThe delivery cycle is based on a SCRUM methodology, with sprints lasting two weeks. The Delivery Team will work on the tasks planned for the sprint, and the Project Lead will monitor the progress and remove any blockers that may arise.\nThe main ceremonies of the delivery cycle are:\nProduct Grooming\n: The Product Manager and the Project Lead review the backlog and prioritize the items for the next sprint. The meeting is performed once before every sprint starts. During this meeting priorities and requirements are discussed, and the team estimates the effort required for each item.\nSupport Planning\n: The Project Lead and the Support Team discuss the tasks gathered from customer tickets and prioritize them. The tasks are then added to the backlog and prioritized. Bugs and defects planned for the next sprint, while small fixes and feature requests are planned for future sprints, or sent to the Product Manager for evaluation.\nSprint Planning\n: Before the beginning of every sprint, the Delivery Team meets to discuss the tasks planned for the sprint. The team breaks down big tasks into smaller items, estimates the effort required, and assigns the tasks to the team members. The team also discusses the sprint goal and the definition of done for all the items.\nStand-Up Meeting\n: Every day, the Delivery Team meets for a short stand-up meeting. Each team member answers one question: if they have any blockers. The meeting is meant to remove any blockers that may arise. In parallel, every team member updates the status of their tasks on a shared board: every day every team member writes what they worked on the previous day, and what they will work on today. This way, the team can see the progress, and we can easily check the history of the tasks.\nRetrospective\n: At the end of every sprint, the Delivery Team meets to discuss what went well and what could be improved. The team discusses the way of working and the process. The outcome of the meeting is a list of action items that are assigned to different team members. The Project Lead will monitor the progress of the action items and will make sure they are implemented. If needed, the tasks are added to the backlog and prioritized.\nInternal Review\n: Before the end of the sprint, the Delivery Team meets with the Product Manager and the Architects to review the work done. The team discusses the tasks completed, and the tasks that are still in progress. This is a way to check the ongoing work and to make sure that everything is on track. The meeting gives visibility to the work done also to people outside the team, like the Product Manager or the Architects.\nDemo\n: At the end of every sprint, the Delivery Team meets with the the stakeholders (the Product Manager and the Professional Services) to demo the work done. The team shows the features developed, and the stakeholders can provide feedback. The feedback is then used to improve the product and to plan the next sprints.\nThe cycle repeats with a new sprint every 2 weeks; in particular periods of the year (like Christmas or summer holidays) the cycle may be longer, to allow the team to take some time off, while keeping the development process efficient.\nContinuous Integration and Deployment\nThe Delivery Team uses a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. The code of all the modules is stored in repositories on a version control system, and the pipeline is configured to pull the code from the repository and build it automatically.\nEvery repository adopts a standard branching model, with a main branch that contains the production-ready code, and feature branches that are used for developing new features.\nThe pipeline is triggered every time a change is pushed to the repository (for all the branches) and it runs a series of automated tests to ensure the quality of the code. If the tests pass, the code can be merged to the main branch; to do this, the developer creates a merge request, and the code is reviewed by another team member. The code is then merged to the main branch, and the pipeline is triggered again to build the relative artifact. Every pipeline on the main branch creates a new artifactory: a Docker image with a specific tag relative to the latest commit. The pipeline then deploys the image to the development environment, where the code is tested by the Delivery Team.\nIn some specific repositories, there is the definition of the Helm charts. The Helm charts contain all the images needed to perform a complete deployment of the product. The charts are versioned, and the pipeline is configured to deploy the charts to the Quality Assurance and Demo environment. Those environments are replicas of realistic environments, and are used to test the new features released. The pipelines for these environments are triggered manually, so that the team can decide when to deploy the new features.\nSince every environment has its own customizations, the pipelines are configured to use different configurations for every environment. The configurations are stored in a separate repository, and the pipelines are configured to pull the configurations from the repository and deploy them to the target environments."

    "text": "Shape Up Guidelines\nA shared playbook to ensure we respect the methodology, deliver with quality, and communicate clearly.\nGeneral Philosophy\nShape Up is designed to help us focus, make meaningful progress, and avoid chaos.\nWe operate in 8-week cycles: 6 weeks for shaping/building and 2 weeks for cooldown.\nThis structure is\nnot optional\n. It exists to reduce stress, avoid endless workstreams, and deliver testable increments on time.\n“Appetite over estimates. Concrete over abstract. Shaped work over backlogs.” –\nShape Up, Basecamp\nCeremonies\n1. Bottom-up Shape proposals\nHere the dev and design team bring proposals to address tech and design debt\n2. Shape Kick-Off\nProduct owner defines which tasks/features need to be evaluated during the cooldown period\n3. Pitch Review\nTeam presents appetite for tasks to be inserted in the shape. Each item must have a pitch with related HLD/LLD if necessary\nIn this meeting we also fine tune appetite on team capacity.\nThe output of this meeting is a list of tasks/features that will be part of the shape\n3. Shape Rescoping\nEvery two weeks the team present the progress on shape items and in case they believe there is a need for rescoping, propose it.\nAt the end of the meeting is clear what has been rescoped ( removed/added ) into the shape\n4. Shape Review\nIn this meeting team show the final result of the shape, the deliverable is a beta release in the demo environment, that can be tested.\n✅ What You Must Do\n1. Shaping the Work\nDefine a\nclear scope\n: intended outcome, technical boundaries, constraints, and trade-offs.\nValidate feasibility\n: resolve all major unknowns before committing to a pitch. HLD is part of shaping.\nCommunicate blockers early\n: uncertainty must be made explicit during shaping.\nNo \"we'll figure it out later\":\nshape the work, or don’t build it\n.\n2. Building the Work\nNever start unshaped work\n.\nRescope actively\nduring the cycle, not in the last few days.\nBy the end of the Shape phase\n, and before entering Cooldown, we must have a\nconsolidated release ready for demo\n. This version must be installable, verifiable, and representative of the shaped scope, in conformity with DoD.\n3. During Cooldown\nNo new development work\n.\nFocus on: bug fixing, testing, and shaping next cycles.\nCooldown is\nintentional time\nto stabilize and prepare—not backlog filler.\n4. Communication\nRaise red flags early\n. Silence delays everything.\nShare daily progress\n: don’t let others guess.\nRescoping is mandatory\n, not optional. Use it.\n❌ What You Must Not Do\n1. No Unbounded Tasks\nDo not start building from vague or unshaped work. Ask for clarity.\n2. No Cooldown Hacking\nDon’t sneak in new features during cooldown. Cooldown is\nsacred\n.\n3. No Silent Rescoping\nDon’t drop scope silently at the end. Raise it when it becomes a risk during rescoping meetings.\n4. No Incomplete Releases\nA release must be testable. “Almost done” ≠ done.\nDefinition of Done\nEach task and MR must be compliant with DoD before being reviewed and merged.\nAccountability\nEach cycle has an\nOwner\n:\nTracks progress\nFacilitates rescoping\nEscalates risks\nEach task has a\nResponsible\n:\nEnsures clarity\nTracks completion\nEveryone is expected to\nspeak up\nif we are going off the rails.\nFinal Note\nShape Up only works if we follow the rules and communicate honestly."

    "text": "Product Design\nPurpose\nProduct Design focuses on creating an intuitive, user-friendly design that meets user needs and enhances the overall experience.\nThe main purpose of Product Design in an enterprise context is to create a design that helps users work more effectively and comfortably with sophisticated tools. In the specific context of data product management, this means building a user experience that streamlines workflows, simplifies, development process and data discovery, and provides seamless access to complex tasks.\nThe end goal is to enhance productivity and ease of use for enterprise users, aligning digital tools closely with business objectives and workflows.\nDesign Values\nTo guide the design decision-making process and, thus, achieve the purpose as defined above, the following set of design values was established:\nInnovative\n: innovation begins with a deep understanding of our users. In the realm of IT enterprise products, innovation is not just a buzzword but a fundamental pillar. We embrace this ethos by fostering creativity and forward-thinking in every aspect. Our user-centric approach ensures that our innovations are not just technologically advanced but also relevant and beneficial to our users.\nConfident\n: confidence is key in our design approach. We know that communicating a sense of trust and reliability is crucial in the IT enterprise sphere where decisions can significantly impact business operations. This approach extends to our user experience and design, providing users with intuitive interfaces and interactions that instill confidence in their daily tasks.\nAssertive\n: assertiveness in design translates to clarity and purpose in every element. Following the principle of assertive communication, the requirements and features of our design are presented clearly and unambiguously. This ensures that users are not left to guess how to navigate or utilize our product. We advocate for the user's needs, ensuring that our solutions will enhance their experience and meet their requirements effectively.\nSimple\n: simplicity lies at the heart of our design system. Our design serves a purpose and contributes to the overall functionality and aesthetics. This approach eliminates unnecessary complexity, making our product more approachable and easier to use. By focusing on simplicity, we enhance user engagement and satisfaction, as our design becomes intuitive and straightforward, enabling users to accomplish their goals with minimal friction.\nKey Processes\nThe design process involves several stages to ensure the product addresses real user needs:\nUser Research and Interviews\n: gaining insights from end users, identifying their pain points, and understanding their workflows are crucial to creating a tool that genuinely helps them.\nWireframing and Prototyping\n: creating wireframes and interactive prototypes to map out workflows and establish the layout of features. This stage ensures we’re on the right track before diving into full-scale design.\nUser Testing and Iteration\n: testing designs with real users allows us to identify usability issues and make improvements. Based on user feedback, we iterate on the design to continually refine the experience.\nCollaboration with Cross-Functional Teams\n: working closely with developers, product managers, and stakeholders ensures that design aligns with technical feasibility and business goals.\nKey Responsibilities\nConducting User Research\n: regularly engaging with internal and external users to understand their workflows, needs, and pain points.\nCreating Prototypes and User Flows\n: designing detailed prototypes and user journeys to visualize how users will interact with the platform and accomplish key tasks.\nEnsuring Consistency\n: maintaining design consistency across the platform, applying a cohesive design system that makes the product feel seamless and professional.\nCollaborating with Product and Engineering Teams\n: partnering closely with other teams to ensure that design choices are technically viable and aligned with business goals.\nMonitoring and Optimizing User Experience\n: continuously analyzing user feedback and product performance to identify improvements, ensuring that the tool remains user-friendly as it evolves."

    "text": "Product Software Development\nPurpose\nOur product software development workflow ensures that all the new features will be efficiently conceptualized, developed and launched by following a structured process, aligning teams and meeting both customers and company needs.\nMoreover, it is a crucial method to deliver high quality features and establish elevated quality standards.\nProduct Software Development Workflow\nThis workflow encompasses all stages, from the conception and validation of a new idea to its deployment and involves various actors at each phase.\nThe key phases of the product development workflow are:\nFeature's Memorandum of Understanding: The Product Manager outlines the concept and requirements while updating the MOU document accordingly.\nPrototype UI/UX: The Feature Team and the UX Designer create different prototypes, each highlighting different pros and cons. The final prototype is chosen jointly with the Product Manager.\nHigh Level Design: The Architect and the Feature Leader outline the system architecture, key components and interactions. The development efforts are divided into epics and estimated.\nLow Level Design: The Feature Team decomposes the epics into more granular issues capturing technical decisions.\nDelivery: The Feature Team implements all the core issues, performs code reviews, and conducts technical tests.\nQuality Assurance: The Quality Assurance Team (with the help of the Product Manager and Product Lead) conducts functional and end-to-end tests.\nFeature Release: The Feature Team updates configurations, updates the migration instructions, and releases the feature in a demo environment.\nProduct Release: The Product Lead creates the associated documentation, writes release notes (including the changelogs) and informs existing customers and the marketing department.\nThe detailed breakdown of all the phases is provided below.\nFeature's Memorandum of Understanding\nIn this phase, the Product Manager outlines the concept and requirements while updating the Memorandum of Understanding document. This document is a live document, evolving over time according to the strategic goals and market needs, defined by the Product Manager.\nFollowing this, the Product Lead will form a Feature Team and initiate preliminary hypotheses for its development strategy. A Feature Team consists of different member of the team, with all the needed skills to develop the feature. Among the Feature Team a Feature Lead is appointed, who is responsible for the feature development and delivery.\nPrototype UI/UX\nPrototyping is an essential phase that helps visualize concepts, validates design and usability and enhances collaboration among the actors involved such as the Development Team, the UX Designer, the Product Manager, the Feature Team and Professional Services.\nIt is crucial for early issue identification, aligning expectations and saving time and resources by refining the product before the development begins.\nUltimately, this leads to a more refined design and a smoother development process.\nThis phase operates independently of Sprints and its key is the fast iteration process.\nThe UI/UX prototyping processes consist of the following steps:\nBrainstorming\n: The UX Designer, Product Manager, Product Lead and Feature Lead conduct a brainstorming session focused on the previously identified MOU feature. The output is typically a preliminary sketch (usually created using Power Point or Miro).\nGeneration of multiple prototypes\n: In this step, the Feature Team, Product Lead, and the UX Designer create different prototypes, each highlighting different pros and cons. The resulting deliverable is a presentation or a set of diagrams (usually created using Power Point or draw.io).\nPrototype sharing and feedback collection\n: The Feature Team and the Product Lead organize a prototype sharing session to gather feedback from UX Designer, Product Manager and Professional Services. After the shared session, the Product Manager, UX designer and Product Lead choose the final prototype that will be turned into interactive design. If there is no unanimous decision, the second and third steps are repeated and continues iteratively until there is a confirmed prototype that can then move on to the next step.\nUser-interactive design\n: The UX Designer translate the prototype sketch into a user-interactive design producing a sharable prototype (usually created using XD or Figma). This prototype is then shared with the Product Lead, Product Manager and Professional Services for feedback.\nUser Testing\n: the UX Designer, in collaboration with testers, conducts user testing and compiles a User Acceptance Report. The user testing could leverage different techniques, such as A/B testing, usability testing, and user interviews.\nFinal decision\n: the UX Designer reviews the XD or Figma prototype based on test results, making adjustments as necessary (the only things that can be left out are external libraries, feasibility checks or smaller details). The final prototype is chosen jointly with the Product Manager and Product Lead.\nIndeed, before moving forward, a quality check is conducted by the Product Manager to ensure that the prototype is aligned with our high quality standard, and that it meets the requirements outlined in the MOU document.\nIf the prototype does not meet these standards, the process will restart from the second step of the iterative prototyping process (new prototypes generation), until the quality standards are met.\nHigh Level Design\nAn High-Level Design (HLD) is crucial for providing a clear, overarching blueprint of the feature before diving into the development process.\nIt guides both the detailed design and implementation, ensuring that the final product meets technical specifications and business requirements. This phase operates independently of sprints and should not usually take more than one week.\nOur HLD process consist of the following steps:\nHLD Definition\n: The Architect and the Feature Leader outlines the system architecture, key components and interactions. The output is the definition of a HLD document (usually on Power Point). This document can have open points and questions that need to be answered before moving to the next phase. Also, there could be a list of PoCs or MVPs to be developed to validate the architecture and the feasibility of the feature.\nSharing session\n: A sharing session is established to gather feedback from all participants on the HLD.\nThe roles involved in this meeting are:\nArchitect\nFeature Leader\nFeature Team\nProduct Manager\nProduct Lead\nTech Module Lead\nThe feedback is then incorporated into the HLD document, and the team iterates on the design until all concerns are addressed.\nQuality gate\n: Before proceeding, the Product Manager conducts a quality check to ensure that the HLD aligns with our high standards. If these standards are not met, the process will revert to the HLD Definition phase for further refinement.\nGeneration of Epics\n: Once the HLD document is completed, the developments are divided into epics and the HLD document updated. Product Lead, Product Manager and Feature Leader are accountable for this actions.\nEstimation\n: Each epic is estimated by the Product Lead and Feature Lead. Usually, the estimation is done in days, but it can be done in story points as well. The epics items are then prioritized based on the estimation and the expected value for the customer. It can happen that some parts of the epics are de-promoted to the backlog, because they are not valuable enough for the customer or they are too complex to be developed in the expected time frame.\nPrioritization and planning\n: The Product Lead and Product Manager initiate the prioritization and planning of the new feature, adjusting the Feature Team as needed. The goal is to ensure that the development efforts are focused to deliver the highest value to the customer.\nDuring this phase, the Architects and Feature Lead can take decisions by crating Proof of Concepts, Minimum Viable Products, or other technical artifacts to validate the architecture and the feasibility of the feature. This is a key step to ensure that the feature can be developed in the expected time frame and with the expected quality. Also, this is the step where we can explore new technologies and new approaches to solve the problem, and choose the best ones.\nLow Level Design\nA Low Level Design is a conceptual type milestones, represents a way of decomposing the high level requirements in more granular issues. It is done only for the prioritized epics and, as per the other phase, a fast iteration is key. This step operates independently of sprints and should not take more than one week per design.\nA single High Level Design can be decomposed into multiple Low Level Designs, each focusing on a specific aspect of the feature. This process ensures that the development team has a clear understanding of the technical requirements and can proceed with the implementation efficiently. Every epic should have one or more Low Level Designs, depending on the complexity of the feature. Keep in mind that writing a Low Level Design is very time consuming, so it is important to write it only for the most complex aspects of the feature.\nOur LLD process consist of the following steps:\nLLD Production\n: In this phase the Feature Team decomposes, on Jira, the epics into more granular issues capturing technical decisions which do not involve writing code (e.g. in the case of a new feature, the LLD could include the definition of the API, the definition of the database schema, the definition of the UI components, etc.). The output is a LLD document that is shared with the Product Manager, Product Lead, Tech Module Lead and Architect.\nRework UI/UX\n: The Feature Team and Product Designer create a more extended design thanks to the LLD definition. This design take in consideration labels, colors, UX and details in general. The output is a new prototype that contains all the details needed for the development. It is not mandatory to have a fully working prototype, but it is important that all the aspects that are not implemented in the prototype are covered with a detailed description and a clear understanding of the expected result.\nLLD Approval\n: In async mode, the Tech Module Leads, Product Lead and Architects confirm the design of the previous stages. If there are details to be changed, the process is repeated iteratively until the design is approved.\nIssues\n: The Feature Team create the issues on Jira, linked to the epics. Note that the \"Definition Of Done\" is mandatory for every issue: it should include all the technical aspects and functional requirements.\nTo check that the Low Level Design reflects the set quality standards, a quality check is conducted by the Product Lead, Architect and Tech Module Lead before proceeding to the next phase. If the set quality standards are not achieved, it means that some more iterations are needed to reach the expected quality, and the process restarts.\nDelivery\nThe Delivery phase consist of the following steps:\nKick-Off\n: The Feature Lead conducts a kick-off meeting to explain all the details of the feature to the Feature Team. The output of this phase is the planning of the first sprint and the assignment of the issues to the team members.\nIssue Implementation\n: The Feature Team, in accordance with the planning carried out and the sprints, proceeds to implement the issues. In this step the output is the Git branch and the Merge Request with its description.\nCheck Compliance\n: The Feature Lead checks for compliance between the definition of done and the content of the branch. The process proceeds only if the issues are delivered with unit tests, configuration updates, and documentation.\nCode Review\n: In this phase, the Feature Lead and the Tech Module Lead insert comments and review notes on the Merge Request. The Feature Team will adjust the development as necessary. The output of this phase is the approval of the Merge Request.\nMerge and Deploy\n: The Feature Lead and the Tech Module Lead rebase the branch on the main one and update the development environment. The development environment is always updated with the latest version of the main branch, so the whole development team can check if the latest features released are working as expected.\nTests Definition\n: The Feature Team writes the functional tests by first defining all the test cases. When executed, a report will be compiled to keep track of the tests performed and the results obtained for all the defined test cases.\nBefore proceeding to the next step a quality check is conducted by the Product Lead to perform the following checks:\nfunctionalities: the feature works as expected\nconfigurations: customers can easily configure the feature\ndocumentation: the feature is well documented\nimpacts for existing customers: the feature does not break existing functionalities\nIf the set quality standards are not achieved, new issues are created and the process restarts.\nQuality Assurance\nDeploy\n: At the end of every sprint, the Product Lead performs the deployment of the main branch in the Quality Assurance environment. The output of this phase includes the creation of a new RC (Release Candidate) and the update of configurations for deploying it in the Quality Assurance environment.\nTesting\n: Once the deployment is complete and the Quality Assurance environment is updated, the Quality Assurance Team and the Product Manager conduct functional tests. The output of this phase is a report that includes all the test cases and their results. The test cases created by the Feature Team are executed by the Quality Assurance Team, and new test cases are added in case some aspects are not covered.\nTest results\n: Based on test results, any identified bugs are opened to be addressed and resolved in the current sprint. This phase is managed by the Quality Assurance and the Feature Team, who handle the prioritization and finalization of the issues.\nUpon completion of these activities, the Product Lead and Product Manager perform a quality check. Furthermore, before releasing the feature, the Product Lead compares the estimated timelines with the actual time taken for delivery. If there are changes to the LLD (Low-Level Design) during development, re-validation through the formal process is not required. The key is to ensure that any changes are clearly communicated to all relevant actors involved.\nWhen a feature is completed, and at the end of every sprint where a milestone is reached, the Feature Team will demonstrate the feature to the Product Manager and the Professional Services Team. This is an opportunity to gather feedback and ensure that the feature meets the requirements outlined in the MOU document.\nFeature Release\nThe Feature Release consist of the following steps:\nConfigurations and Installation\n: The Feature Team and Product Lead update the configurations for all the environments, the installation steps note, and the sandbox checklist.\nRelease Note\n: The Feature Team write down the migration notes in the installation repository\nRelease in Demo\n: The Product Lead release the feature in the demo environment.\nNote that for any new feature that is intrinsic to the core Witboost environment and needs to be integrated into the Playground environments as well, it's important to update the Playground provisioning checklist accordingly. Anyway, the Feature Team should always inform the Infrastructure Team that in the next iterations of the Playground, the newly introduced feature and any related changes must be incorporated into the environments, and all the necessary configurations must be updated.\nIn this phase, it is necessary to:\nDocument in the installation repository all the steps that the customer needs to follow to install the new version.\nUpdate in the configurations' repository the configuration files for the internal environments.\nProduct Release\nThe product release is managed by the Product Lead, and it results in a new version of the product that is available to the customers. The Product Lead is responsible for creating the associated documentation, writing release notes (including the changelogs) and informing existing customers and the marketing department. In particular, the Product Lead will:\ncreate a new stable tag for all the repositories involved in the release;\ncreate a new stable tag for all the Helm charts;\ngenerate the changelogs for the release;\nwrite the release notes with the new features and the bug fixes;\ngenerate a security report for the release;\ninform the marketing department about the new release;\ninform the customers about the new release.\nThe Product Lead will also update the documentation repository with the new version of the documentation (which is anyway shipped along with the product in the Helm charts)."

    "text": "Quality Assurance\nPurpose\nEnsures the software is free from defects and meets quality standards before release.\nTest Planning and Strategy\nThe test planning and strategy is defined by different type of tests and testing tools.\nFor Witboost, the key testing types are:\nFunctional\n, which focus on validating that the software's features work according to the specified requirements:\nUnit Testing\n: Verifying individual components or functions for correct behavior. Unit tests are written by the developers and executed automatically as part of the continuous integration process. The pipelines are executed for every commit and the results are publicly available;\nIntegration Testing\n: Ensuring that different software modules work seamlessly together; integration tests are not always automated, but developers can test the integration of their code with other modules in the development environment. There is no golden rule for this, since it heavily depends on the complexity of the integration, but the development environment is always updated with the latest version of the main branch, so the whole Feature Team can check if the latest features released are working as expected, and not conflicting with one another;\nSystem Testing\n: Assessing the complete system's functionality and performance against specified requirements; the Quality Assurance environment is updated periodically with a stable release, and the Quality Assurance team can check the system as a whole to ensure that all the features work as expected and that the system is stable and reliable. In the Quality Assurance environment, we publish also integrations with third-party services, so that the Quality Assurance team can test external integrations as well;\nNon-functional\nwhich address aspects like performance, security, usability and reliability, ensuring that the application can handle stress, operates securely and delivers a seamless user experience:\nPenetration Testing\n: Identifying vulnerabilities in the software and assessing its resistance to cyber attacks. In Witboost, we perform periodic penetration tests to identify potential security vulnerabilities and ensure that the software is secure and compliant with industry standards. The tests are conducted by external security experts who simulate real-world attacks to identify potential weaknesses in the software: the results are shared with the Feature Team and the Product Lead, who address the identified issues and implement the necessary security measures;\nPerformance Testing\n: Measuring the software's responsiveness, stability and scalability under various load conditions; performance testing is executed both by the Feature Team and the Quality Assurance team to ensure that the software can handle peak usage and deliver a consistent user experience. Every time a new feature could be impacted by performance issues, the Feature Team writes performance tests, or perform integration tests directly. The Quality Assurance team, on the other hand, performs stress tests on the Quality Assurance environment: this is usually done by simulating a huge number of elements in the system, elements with a lot of data, or users with limited access to the system. The results are shared with the Feature Team and the Product Lead, who address the identified issues and implement the necessary performance optimizations;\nSecurity Testing\n: Identifying potential vulnerabilities in the software and assessing its resistance to various security threats. Periodically the Development Team performs vulnerability assessments and security scans to identify potential security vulnerabilities and ensure that the software is secure and compliant with industry standards. This is done using automated tools that scan the images and the codebase for known vulnerabilities and security issues. A complete scan is performed at every stable release, to understand the security impacts for customers.\nTest Case Development\nA crucial element is represented by the Definition of Done (DoD), defined during sprints planning in our development workflow. The DoD sets specific criteria that must be met for a feature or user story to be considered complete, including successful execution of all relevant tests (e.g., unit, integration, system, and user acceptance tests) and resolution of identified defects. By incorporating the DoD into test planning, the team can establish a shared understanding of what it means to deliver fully functional, high-quality software.\nCreating test cases is a critical part of the software testing process, as it ensures that every aspect of the application's functionality and performance is thoroughly evaluated. All the test cases are discussed by the Quality Assurance team with the Feature Team and the Product Lead to ensure that they cover all the necessary scenarios and edge cases. The test cases are then executed by the Quality Assurance team to verify that the software meets the specified requirements and quality standards.\nAutomated Testing\nDeveloping and maintaining automated tests is the first way to ensure high standards of quality and also to ensure continuous integration and deployment.\nIts primary goal is to improve efficiency and accuracy by running repetitive and time-consuming tests, such as regression and performance checks, faster and more consistently than manual methods.\nIn Witboost, the automated test are maintained by the Quality Assurance team, and they are run as part of the continuous integration process to ensure that new code changes do not introduce defects or regressions. The automated tests are written using testing frameworks (e.g. WebdriverIO) and are executed automatically by the CI/CD pipeline every night. A report is generated after each test run, highlighting any failures or issues that need to be addressed.\nManual Testing\nWhere automation testing is not feasible or effective we perform manual tests.\nThese tests are essential for scenarios that require human insight, creativity, or judgment such as evaluating user experience, visual elements, and complex interactions that automated scripts cannot fully capture or replicate.\nWhenever a feature is released in the Quality Assurance environment, the Quality Assurance team is briefed on the new feature and its expected behavior by the Feature Team. The team then writes all the needed test cases, and performs manual tests to validate the feature against the specified requirements and quality standards. The results of the manual tests are documented on the reporting system and shared with the Feature Team and Product Lead for review and feedback.\nBefore every major release all the test cases created are executed by the Quality Assurance team to ensure that no regressions have been introduced. In case of any issues, the Quality Assurance opens bug reports that are then addressed by the Feature Team. Every new patch release is tested by the Quality Assurance team to ensure that the bug fixes have been successfully implemented and that the issues have been resolved.\nBug Tracking and Reporting\nThere are no constraint on the tools used for bug tracking and reporting, but in WItboost we use Jira since it is already connected with the Customer Support dashboards; in this way, we can easily connect defects found by the Quality Assurance team, with similar problems highlighted by customers. The Quality Assurance team is responsible for tracking and reporting bugs. The bug reports include detailed information about the issue, such as:\nScenario Summary: the reporter summarizes the scenario and provides a history reference, such as what happened in previous versions;\nProblem Statement: verbose description of the problem, i.e. what happens;\nExpected Behaviour: what should happen if everything worked correctly;\nSteps to Reproduce: all information needed to reproduce the problem, in a way that the Feature Team can easily understand and replicate the issue;\nProposed Solution: possible solution to the problem, if known;\nAffected Environment: state the environment where the problem occurred;\nAffected Version: indicate the version of the software where the problem occurred;\nSecurity Level: indicate the security risk of this bug, and how it could affect the users;\nPriority: indicate the priority of the bug, as perceived by the reporter;\nIt is extremely important to simplify the issue resolution to attach to all the reports all the relevant screenshots and/or logs.\nThe Feature Team then investigates the bug, identifies the root cause, and implements a fix. Once the fix is implemented, and the patched software is available in the QUality Assurance environment, the Quality Assurance team retests the feature to ensure that the issue has been resolved."

    "section": "Product Development",
    "level": "2.1.1.5",
    "text": "Release Management\nPurpose\nManages the process of deploying new software versions or updates to customers.\nRelease Management Process\nThe release management process involves planning of a new release, documentation generation, publishing of the artifacts, and the upgrade process for the customers. Every release represents a new stable version of the software that includes new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and security updates. In case of critical bugs or security vulnerabilities, hot-fixes or patches are released to address the issues without waiting for the next stable release.\nThe release management process ensures that the software is delivered to customers in a controlled and efficient manner, with minimal impacts on their operations.\nPlanning\nThe release planning process involves defining the scope of the release, including the features, enhancements, and bug fixes that will be included. The release plan is created based on the product roadmap (updated with customers feedback) and internal priorities. The release plan is updated accordingly to reflect changes in priorities, customer feedback, or new requirements.\nTools\nWitboost uses semantic versioning (major.minor.patch format) to indicate the significance of changes in each release:\nmajor versions include significant new features or changes that may not be backward compatible; major releases could include breaking changes or significant migration efforts.\nminor versions include new features, enhancements, and bug fixes that are usually backward compatible; some minor migration efforts may be required.\npatch versions include bug fixes and security updates that are backward compatible.\nWith every new tag in the repositories, the CI/CD pipeline is triggered to build the software, run the tests, and generate the artifacts. The artifacts are then published to the Witboost's artifact repository, where they are available for download by customers. The artifacts are used first to upgrade the internal environments (quality assurance and demo) to validate the new releases.\nWitboost uses Helm to bundle together all the images required from the different repositories to deploy the software in a Kubernetes cluster. The Helm charts are versioned and published to the Witboost's Helm repository, where they are available for download. Customers can directly download the Helm charts to deploy the software in their Kubernetes clusters, and they can customize the values.yaml files to configure the software according to their needs.\nDocumentation\nEvery Witboost release is released with a set of documentation that includes release notes, changelogs, migration guides, and user manuals. The documentation is generated as part of the release process and is published on the Witboost's documentation website. The documentation is also available in the software package for offline access.\nEvery release includes:\nRelease Notes: A summary of the changes, enhancements, and bug fixes included in the release.\nChangelogs: Detailed information about the changes made to the software, including the history of issues closed and pull requests merged.\nMigration guides: Step-by-step instructions for upgrading to the new version, including any migration efforts required.\nVersion Matrix: A compatibility matrix that shows which versions of the software modules are included in the release and their compatibility with other modules.\nWith every release, the documentation is updated to reflect the changes made in the software, including the user manual and the administrator guide. The configurations are updated to reflect the new features and enhancements, and the troubleshooting section is updated to include any new issues or resolutions.\nUpgrade Process\nWitboost averages a new stable release every 2 months, with hotfix and patch releases in between.\nSince patches and new releases are frequent, Witboost uses an automated deployment process to ensure that customers can easily update their software to the latest version. Witboost provides release notes for each version, detailing the changes, enhancements, and bug fixes included in the release.\nCustomers are not forced to upgrade to the latest version of Witboost, but they are encouraged to do so to take advantage of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. Usually releases are backward compatible and require small to no migration at all, so customers usually carry out the migration autonomously. Anyway, Witboost provides support for customers who need assistance with the upgrade process, including migration efforts for all the releases. There is no need to upgrade to intermediate releases when installing a new version, as each release includes all the changes from previous versions (e.g. a customer on version 1.1 can upgrade directly to version 1.3 without installing version 1.2).\nUsually all customers perform the migration process in a testing environment first, where they perform some tests (functional, penetration, security, etc) to validate that the new release is working before migrating the production environment. The documentation for each release includes a migration guide that provides step-by-step instructions for upgrading to the new version. The global documentation includes a section on releases containing the release notes and bug fixes for each version.\nEnd Of Life (EOL) of Witboost versions\nEach version follows a defined lifecycle with specific support windows. Minor versions receive active patching and maintenance for 24 months from their initial release date, covering both standard minor versions and backporting minor versions. Major versions maintain extended support, with patching provided on both old minor and major versions for a 24-month period.\nOnce a version reaches its end of life, it will no longer receive security patches, bug fixes, or updates of any kind. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to a supported version before their current version reaches end of life to ensure continued security and stability. Patch versions are issued as needed throughout the support window to address critical issues and vulnerabilities in supported versions.\nExample:\nConsider a product that releases Major Version 2.0 in January 2023. Shortly after, Minor Version 2.1 is released in March 2023, followed by Minor Version 2.2 in August 2023.\nVersion 2.1 will receive active patching and maintenance until March 2025 (24 months from its release date)\nVersion 2.2 will receive active patching and maintenance until August 2025 (24 months from its release date)\nWhen Major Version 3.0 is released in June 2024, the support clock resets for the new major version line. However, backporting of critical fixes continues for Version 2.2 (the latest minor in the 2.x line) until August 2025.\nAfter August 2025, Version 2.2 reaches end of life and will no longer receive any patches or updates. Users still running Version 2.x should plan their migration to Version 3.x well before this date to maintain security coverage and access to bug fixes."

    "section": "Product Development",
    "level": "2.1.1.6",
    "text": "Security\nPurpose\nEnsures the software meets security standards and complies with regulatory requirements.\nSecurity and Compliance\nThe main goal of the security process in place is to define a security assessment and threat modeling. To identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in the software, we adopt the following practices:\nDaily vulnerability scanning of the dependencies and libraries used in the software. This is performed by an automated tool that checks for known vulnerabilities in all the images that we release (CVEs). All the vulnerabilities are categorized based on their severity and are fixed based on the severity level; all the vulnerabilities of level high/critical are resolved as soon as a resolution is released.\nPeriodic penetration testing to identify potential security weaknesses in the software. This is performed by a third-party security firm that simulates real-world attacks on the software to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. After every penetration test cycle, we receive a detailed report with the identified vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation, which we address promptly. In case of vulnerabilities found, we release a new version, and we perform another penetration test to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been fixed.\nRegular security code reviews to identify security flaws in the codebase. This is performed manually by the development team during the code review process, where they look for common security issues (such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and insecure deserialization, etc). The team also uses a third-party automated tool that performs SAST analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase. The tool provides a report for the development team to review and address any identified issues, and the analysis is performed before every release.\nRegarding compliance with security standards, we as a company also adhere to industry best practices and standards such as ISO 27001 (Security of Information), ISO 27701 (Security of Information according to GDPR), ISO 9001 (Quality System), and ISO 22301 (Business Continuity) to ensure that the software meets the highest security standards.\nApplication Security\nOn a more general scope, Witboost adheres to the following security policies and techniques to ensure comprehensive protection.\nAuthentication and Authorization\nWitboost delegates the authentication to a third-party service provider, chosen from a list of supported ones (all main OAuth 2.0 providers are supported, and new ones can be easily integrated); usually customers will use their default providers (like Microsoft Entra ID) which provides a secure and reliable authentication mechanism. The service provider can support different security levels, like multi-factor authentication, and WItboost will integrate with it also to get the organization structure: which users and groups are supported, and how users are assigned to the groups they belong to. This ensures that only authorized users can access the software and that their identities are verified securely.\nAuthorization is handled through an RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system, where users and/or groups are assigned roles that determine what actions they can perform in the software. The roles are collections of specific permissions: they are defined based on the user's job function and responsibilities, and they are assigned to users by the administrators. This ensures that users can only access the features and data that are relevant to their role, and that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access.\nThe combination of the two mechanisms ensures that the software is secure and that only authorized users can access it, and that it can completely governed from outside Witboost. Even the RBAC mechanism is managed inside Witboost, a customer can define the roles only fro groups, and change the assignment of the users to the groups from the organization provider. In this way, the customer can manage the access to the software without the need to access the software itself. Alternatively, the customer can define the roles and assign them to the users directly from Witboost, and the product will manage the access to the resources.\nInfrastructure Security\nThe infrastructure where Witboost is installed, is provided by the customer, and the customer is responsible for the security of the infrastructure. This means that the customer can choose to deploy Witboost on-premises or on a cloud provider, and to provide all the necessary security measures to protect the infrastructure.\nWitboost requires a Postgres database, and Kubernetes cluster to run. Usually the Postgres database is provided through a managed service, and the customer can choose to deploy the product on a managed Kubernetes service (like GKE, EKS, or AKS) or on a self-managed Kubernetes cluster. In both cases, the customer is responsible for the security of the cluster.\nThe customer can implement different security measures to protect the infrastructure, and to make the data reliable (like backups, disaster recovery, and high availability).\nUsually, customers choose to deploy Witboost in one or more Kubernetes clusters, and to use a managed Postgres database to store the data. The Kubernetes clusters are not reachable from the internet, and all the communication with the software is done through a reverse proxy that is managed by the customer. If any of the pods need to contact external services, the customer can configure the firewall rules to allow only the necessary traffic.\nOne important example of external interaction could be between the \"Provisioning Coordinator\" module, and the Tech Adapters, which are external services that are used to provision the resources in the third-party systems. Since the Tech Adapters are developed and maintained by the customer, but their execution can create/destroy resources in the third-party systems, the customer can deploy them outside of the Kubernetes cluster, and needs to be sure that they are invoked only by the Provisioning Coordinator, which handles the authorization. To ensure that the Tech Adapters are invoked only by the Provisioning Coordinator, Witboost allows you to setup an mTLS (mutual TLS) communication between the two services. This is performed by generating a certificate for the Provisioning Coordinator, and configuring the Tech Adapters to accept only requests that are signed by the certificate. This ensures that only the Provisioning Coordinator can invoke the Tech Adapters, and that the communication is secure.\nMonitoring and Logging\nAs already introduced, the deployment of Witboost is managed by the customer, who can decide to deploy it on-premises or on a cloud provider. In both cases, the customer is responsible for the security of the infrastructure. The customer can then access different functionalities to monitor the software and the infrastructure.\nWitboost provides an auditing mechanism, which stores all the actions performed by the users in the system. The audit log contains information about the user who performed the action, the action itself, the timestamp, and the resource involved (along with the URL, module, and type of action). The audit log is stored in the database, and it can be accessed by the administrators to review the actions performed by the users and to investigate any suspicious activity.\nEvery pod has an API that can be invoked to check its health status. This is the same mechanism used by Helm to check the readiness and liveliness of the microservices. The API returns a status code that indicates whether the pod is healthy or not, and it can be used by the administrators to monitor the health of the software and to take action if any issues are detected.\nIn addition to this, every Witboost's pod (the software is deployed in a microservices architecture) generates logs that can be collected and stored in a centralized logging system. The log level of each pod can be configured by the customer, and the logs can be accessed by the administrators to monitor the health of the software and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise."

It acts as a strategic function that connects the product’s value proposition with the market, translating business and product goals into coherent, measurable initiatives across channels and touchpoints.\nProduct Marketing is responsible for defining and maintaining the\nproduct positioning and messaging\n, ensuring consistency, clarity, and relevance across market-facing communications. Through this responsibility, Product Marketing ensures that the product is clearly differentiated, correctly understood, and effectively represented across all stages of the customer journey.\nThe function operates across the full customer lifecycle - from first exposure to the brand, through evaluation and purchase, and into product advocacy - working in close collaboration with Sales, Product Management, and Customer Success.\nMarketing Vision\nThe Product Marketing function embraces both:\nTraditional Marketing responsibilities\n, such as brand awareness, demand generation, communication, and pipeline contribution\nAn extended, sales-impact-driven vision\n, where Product Marketing actively supports revenue creation at an account level, enabling Sales with insights, content, positioning, and targeted initiatives aimed at high-value accounts\nIn this model, Product Marketing contributes not only to the generation of\nMarketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)\nthat support product discovery at a sales level, but also to the identification, nurturing, and activation of\nMarketing Qualified Accounts (MQAs)\nthat support direct deal creation and acceleration, supporting a more integrated and effective Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy.\nEach campaign or Product Marketing area is associated with\nspecific success metrics\n, while still contributing to the overall objectives of the function. Performance is continuously monitored to inform prioritization, resource allocation, and iteration.\nThese are further complemented by secondary metrics tied to individual initiatives (e.g. reach, engagement, adoption, conversion rates), all of which ultimately feed into the broader goals of demand generation, brand strength, and product growth.\nWithin the\nGTM framework\n, Product Marketing plays a central role by shaping market perception, driving pipeline creation, and enabling Sales execution through messaging, assets, insights, and account-level initiatives.\nAs part of the Product circle, a recurring\nGTM Review\nis held once every three weeks, during which Product Marketing, together with the other GTM functions, reviews key KPIs related to pipeline generation and deal progression. This review is supported by a shared\nG\nTM Control Plane** file, maintained in the Product circle’s SharePoint, which provides a single source of truth for GTM performance, priorities, and follow-up actions.\nRisk Management\nMarketing contributes to the company’s structured\nRisk Management process\nthrough a centralized\nRisk Register\n, maintained in SharePoint.\nThe Risk Register defines:\nRisk categories\nLikelihood and impact assessments\nMitigation actions\nAssociated monitoring KPIs\nThis process ensures proactive identification and mitigation of risks related to market positioning, pipeline generation, brand perception, execution capacity, and dependency on channels or partners.\nFunnel Governance, Qualification, & Attribution framework\nIn alignment with the Product Marketing Vision, the function operates across two complementary but distinct progression models, with the aim of producing\ndemo-ready*\npipeline:\n1. Lead-Based Funnel (MQL Model)\nThis represents Marketing’s traditional structured contribution to pipeline generation through awareness, demand generation, lead generation, and lifecycle progression.\nContacts are progressed from:\nSubscriber → Lead → Engaged Lead → MQL\nA contact may be classified as MQL when sufficient qualification evidence demonstrates readiness for Sales engagement.\nQualification criteria may include:\nMeaningful engagement following a pre-qualifying source (campaign, event)\nSustained content interaction and website behavior\nEngagement with BOFU or strategic assets\nDirect inbound contact\nExplicit demo request\nOnce marked as\nMQL\n:\nThe contact is updated in the CRM lifecycle stage.\nIt becomes part of the structured Sales pipeline.\nSales assumes proactive follow-up responsibility.\n2. Account-Based Model (MQA Model)\nBeyond individual lead qualification, Product Marketing operates an extended account-level model focused on strategically relevant and high-value companies.\nUnder this model, Product Marketing:\nIdentifies and prioritizes accounts based on engagement and intent\nApplies deeper qualification and presales validation techniques\nEnables Sales through structured intelligence and coordinated outreach\nThese accounts are managed through the\nMarketing Qualified Account (MQA)\nframework.\nThe MQA process follows this sequence:\nInternal review within Marketing via the MQA file available in SharePoint.\nApplication of presales techniques and intent-based validation.\nStructured sharing with Sales through a dedicated working list.\nCross-functional alignment during periodic sync meetings.\n*Demo-ready reflects Marketing validation that the contact is commercially relevant and ready for structured Sales follow-up - not merely that an action has occurred.\nDirect requests & presales validation\nDirect inbound requests - including demo submissions or direct contact messages - receive priority and structured validation before Sales handover.\nThese requests are:\nReviewed directly by the Global Marketing Director\nAssessed against ICP alignment, relevance, and strategic fit\nSubject to an initial presales-oriented outreach using structured templates and contextual qualification\nDirect requests may result in:\nMQL classification\nMQA prioritization\nOr structured cross-based nurturing by both marketing and sales\nCRM Workflows and Automation\nAutomation supports both progression models.\nWorkflows are triggered by predefined actions and operate in the background to:\nProgress leads through lifecycle stages (Lead-Based model)\nEnrich and structure CRM data (supporting both models)\nTwo primary workflow categories exist:\nA. Lead Progression Workflows: Triggered by engagement signals (form fills, list membership, behavioral thresholds).\nObjective: structured movement toward MQL qualification.\nB. CRM Enrichment Workflows: Triggered by conditional logic (intent topic identified, lifecycle duration, engagement patterns).\nObjective: structured intelligence for prioritization, reporting, and account-level analysis.\nEach Product Marketing macro-area may activate dedicated workflows aligned with this framework.\nAttribution Framework\nInternal Attribution (Performance Optimization)\nFor internal channel performance analysis, Marketing applies a Time-Decay Attribution Model, using a 7-day half-life formula:\ny = 2^(-x/7)\nThis ensures:\nRecognition of multi-touch journeys\nProximity-based weighting\nAnalytical rigor for channel comparison\nGTM-Level Attribution (Deal Reporting)\nAt the macro Go-To-Market level, attribution is analyzed using:\nOriginal Lead Source (OLS)\nand related date of creation\nConverting Source (CS)\nand related first date of conversion\nThese may include:\nMarketing channels\nSales outreach\nPartner channels\nOther inbound sources\nFor high-level reporting:\nOLS = 50% credit\nCS = 50% credit\nThis ensures balanced recognition between sourcing and closing influence, particularly within the Deals section of the CRM, where active and progressing accounts are periodically evaluated during GTM reviews.\nThrough its internal MQA file, Marketing additionally tracks subsequent conversion dates for accounts that stall and later re-enter active sales progression, enabling deeper journey analysis without altering CRM attribution integrity.\nGovernance Principles\nTo preserve integrity across both models:\nLifecycle stages must reflect objective engagement evidence\nAttribution fields (OLS, CS, enrichment properties) must remain fact-based\nQualification criteria must be consistently applied\nMQL and MQA serve different strategic purposes and must not be conflated"

It connects positioning and messaging to execution across web, search, paid media, social channels, and marketing automation - ensuring that traffic, engagement, and intent signals are translated into structured funnel progression.\nWebsite\nThe website is the product’s primary owned channel and digital infrastructure. It serves multiple strategic functions:\nDemand and lead generation\nBrand positioning and authority building\nSales enablement and demo facilitation\nPartner marketing visibility\nTechnical documentation and product education\nAll digital acquisition efforts mostly converge on the website, making it the central conversion and qualification layer within Product Marketing.\nWebsite updates are not purely aesthetic; they reflect positioning evolution and go-to-market refinement.\nThe lifecycle of any page\n(new or existing) follows a structured process:\nScope is defined based on messaging updates, pricing iterations, new capabilities, feature updates, campaign needs, or strategic shifts\nPage structure and UX are designed to reflect the intended objective (education, conversion, enablement, authority)\nContent is developed or updated in alignment with positioning and GEO/SEO priorities\nPages are periodically reviewed for accuracy, performance, and technical integrity\nMajor structural or strategic changes are tracked in the Website Changes file for visibility and governance\nLanding Pages\nLanding pages are\nconversion-focused environments\ncreated for specific demand generation objectives and campaign planning. They are often intentionally isolated from broader navigation to maximize message clarity and conversion rate.\nThey require, at minimum, collaboration between:\nThe Digital Officer (page structure, build, tracking implementation)\nThe Campaign Manager (ads, email assets, workflows, targeting logic)\nLanding pages are built within a defined scope such as:\nCampaign-specific support\nKeyword clusters\nCapability or service testing\nEvent registration\nAssessment tools\nEach landing page is directly connected to a defined acquisition source to ensure message match and measurable performance.\nMicrosites\nIn support of ecosystem growth and credibility transfer, as well as to support or enable co-marketing initiatives, dedicated microsites may be developed to serve specific strategic goals, i.e.\nhttps://partners.witboost.com/\nForms\nForms represent the\ntechnical conversion interface\nof Product Marketing. Their logic must balance conversion optimization with sufficient qualification depth to support downstream routing and prioritization.\nThey are used for, but not limited to:\nContent access\nEvent registrations\nDemo requests\nMeeting bookings\nAssessment tools\nForms are created on a need basis, capturing only relevant qualification fields. They act as:\nThe entry point into the CRM for new contacts\nAn enrichment layer for existing contacts\nA workflow trigger for automated follow-up\nMarketing Emails\nEmail Marketing is a structured channel used to support demand generation, lead nurturing, brand reinforcement, and campaign execution.\nEmails may take two primary forms:\nOne-off communications\nThese are single-instance emails deployed according to specific operational needs, such as:\nAnnouncements & stand-alone communications\nEvent invitations\nTime-sensitive initiatives\nAutomated/Workflow-based communications\nWhere communication extends beyond a single interaction, often lives within a campaign logic, and where automation via the CMS/CRM is implemented. These emails are triggered by defined user behaviors or lifecycle stages, such as:\nContent downloads\nEvent registrations or attendance\nAd engagement\nWebsite activity\nForm submissions\nABM initiatives\nAutomated sequences ensure:\nConsistency of messaging\nScalable follow-up\nTimely engagement\nStructured funnel progression\nEmail workflows are aligned with qualification logic and funnel stage. They may include educational resources, case studies, product information, demo access links, or meeting booking options. Product Marketing email activity supports structured engagement and qualification. It is designed to move contacts across defined lifecycle stages.\nSEO & GEO (Search & Generative Engine Optimization)\nSEO for traditional search engines and keyword ranking and GEO to ensure AI-driven systems and conversational engines accurately reference, describe, and surface the brand in relevant prompts and topic clusters - are foundational to\nlong-term organic demand capture\n.\nThe two are interdependent, with SEO forming the technical and structural backbone for GEO visibility.\nSEO/GEO aims to:\nCapture high-intent search demand\nImprove authority in core product and category topics\nOptimize technical structure for crawlability\nStrengthen competitive positioning\nImprove brand presence in AI-generated outputs\nBoth are influenced by:\nContent quality and depth\nDomain authority\nStructured data and technical optimization\nBrand and author credibility signals\nSEO/GEO Process\nSEO/GEO strategy:\nIs defined annually using performance data, OKRs, and positioning priorities\nIs embedded within the broader Marketing strategy\nInforms the Master SEO and Master GEO tracking documents available in Product Marketing’s SharePoint\nExecution includes:\nKeyword clustering and prioritization\nOn-page and structural optimization\nTechnical improvements in coordination with Internal IT\nMonitoring competitor ranking and prompt visibility\nTracking evolution via Google Search Console and other tools\nContacts generated via SEO/GEO enter the same funnel infrastructure as other inbound sources, with source-level tracking informing segmentation and follow-up logic.\nSocial Media Management\nSocial media is used for authority building, ecosystem visibility, and selective demand support.\nIts strategic purpose is to:\nPosition the company as a category leader\nAmplify product updates and technical insights\nSupport demand generation efforts\nStrengthen long-term thought leadership credibility\nPrimary Channels:\nLinkedIn\n(B2B engagement, product updates, thought leadership)\nYouTube\n(product demos, recorded events, educational videos)\nThe Product Communications Officer oversees publishing cadence and consistency. Product Managers provide technical inputs for feature-related communications.\nSEM (Search Engine Marketing)\nSEM is a controlled\nacquisition channel\ndesigned to support both demand capture and category visibility. It operates within the broader Product Marketing strategy and aligns with defined audience, positioning, and pipeline objectives. It is a structured amplification layer within the digital ecosystem supporting inbound acquisition, reinforcing messaging consistency, and complementing organic and outbound efforts.\nThe purpose of SEM is to:\nCapture high-intent demand from actively researching buyers\nIncrease visibility within priority accounts and roles\nReinforce category positioning\nSupport mid- and lower-funnel progression\nExpand reach within strategically relevant audiences\nSEM activities are structured around clear intent segmentation (e.g., high-intent demand capture vs. awareness expansion), ensuring alignment between audience targeting, messaging, and landing environment.\nCampaign design principles include\n:\nAlignment between ad messaging and landing page experience\nDefined conversion objectives\nControlled qualification thresholds\nIntegration with CRM and reporting systems\nContinuous performance monitoring against agreed KPIs\nChannel selection (e.g., search platforms, professional networks, display/video environments) is determined by strategic audience fit and funnel objective rather than by format preference alone.\nSEM performance is evaluated using a balanced measurement framework that may include:\nDirect conversions\nAssisted conversions\nInfluence on pipeline creation\nEngagement quality indicators\nContribution to strategic account penetration\nReputation Management\nMarketing monitors engagement and external feedback across managed platforms (e.g., review sites, social channels).\nSignificant positive or negative feedback is tracked to identify potential reputational implications. When required, incidents are escalated and coordinated with Witboost’s Lead Link and Customer Success to review the event and ensure consistent and timely response."

    "text": "Sales Enablement\nSales Enablement is the structured function through which Product Marketing equips Sales and Presales with the tools, intelligence, frameworks, and activation programs required to accelerate pipeline creation and product adoption.\nIt operates across two interconnected layers:\nEnablement Infrastructure\n– foundational assets, onboarding, qualification logic, and sales frameworks.\nPresales Activation\n– Product Marketing initiatives that sit between Marketing’s Bottom of Funnel (BOFU) and Sales’ Top of Funnel (TOFU), ensuring continuity in the buyer journey.\nThe objective is to increase response velocity and ensure that qualified interest translates efficiently into opportunity creation.\n1. Enablement Infrastructure\nProduct Marketing contributes to structured activation programs for new Sales and Technical Presales team members. These programs are designed to reduce ramp time and ensure consistency in product positioning and value articulation.\nTypical components include:\nOnboarding Kit\n: positioning documents, ICP definition, intent categories, messaging frameworks, and approved decks\nDemo Acceleration Kit\n: structured demo flows, use-case-based walkthroughs, objection handling guidance, and content usage guidelines\nCRM Playbook\n: guidance on how to interpret and leverage marketing signals, intent topics, lifecycle stages, lead status definitions, and deal construction logic within the CRM.\nProduct Marketing supports standardized qualification strategies by\nembedding structured intent logic into both marketing and sales funnel stages\n.\nIntent Topics\nare defined as structured market categories aligned with the product offering and how buyers research and frame their challenges. These categories are:\nEmbedded within funnel entry points\nOperationalized at CRM level across Marketing and Sales\nUsed to guide first-touch qualification and discovery\nIn parallel, established methodologies (e.g., BANT model) are supported to ensure structured discovery and qualification consistency.\nEach intent topic is supported by:\nDedicated positioning decks\nTailored value proposition articulation\nSupporting content and proof points\nThis approach enables Product Marketing to move toward thematic prequalification, while providing Sales with a clearer narrative direction for first engagement and structured discovery.\n2. Presales Activation Layer\nPresales, in this context, refers to specialized initiatives managed by Product Marketing that operate\nbetween inbound qualification and direct sales engagement\n.\nThe purpose is to ensure that:\nBOFU marketing efforts and Sales outreach do not function as disconnected stages\nBuyer engagement remains coherent and trust-building\nHigh-intent accounts receive structured activation prior to formal sales cycle begins\nThis layer is particularly relevant in enterprise environments where multiple stakeholders and extended evaluation processes influence deal progression.\nPresales activations and initiatives may include\n:\nA) Intelligence-Led Events\nSmaller-scale, curated initiatives such as targeted roundtables are organized for selected new or existing accounts.\nThese initiatives:\nFocus on clearly defined market or intent topics\nAre supported by account-level intelligence data\nProvide Sales with contextual insight prior to live interaction\nThe objective is to steer conversations toward concrete problem resolution and value alignment rather than generic product introduction, improving the quality of first interactions.\nB) Presales Campaigns (Account-Targeted Activation)\nPresales campaigns are structured initiatives aimed at specific, pre-identified accounts or segments that meet ICP and intent thresholds. These may include:\nSyndication partnerships with relevant industry brands\nMulti-touch outreach based on high-intent behavioral signals\nPersonalized engagement sequences\nUnlike standard MQL or MQA flows, these initiatives often result in\nHQLs (Highly Qualified Leads)\n, contacts that exceed baseline marketing qualification due to layered intent, ICP alignment, and behavioral indicators.\nSales receives structured context of demo-ready leads, including:\nPrior qualification rationale\nIdentified pain points\nEngagement history\nIntent topic mapping\nThis approach increases the probability of response and reduces early discovery friction.\nC) Demo Program (Quarterly Webinar Series)\nThe Demo Program is a recurring activation initiative designed to:\nProvide structured product visibility to new and existing accounts\nRe-engage previously stalled opportunities\nCreate a low-friction pathway to demo discovery\nIt functions both as pre-sales acceleration and reactivation mechanism\n, supporting pipeline continuity.\nD) Account-Based Marketing (ABM)\nABM initiatives are deployed for prioritized accounts that meet defined strategic and structured predictive indicators (e.g., Pipeline Predict Score thresholds).\nThis typically include:\nAccount research and mapping\nPersona-specific messaging\nPersonalized assets (including tailored, problem-resolution videos)\nCoordinated paid and organic touchpoints\nIntent data and CRM insights are used to refine timing, messaging focus, and channel mix.\nE) Product Tours & Video Demos\nInteractive experiences are developed to provide:\nHigh-level product orientation\nPersona-specific benefit articulation\nThematic journeys aligned with intent categories\nF) Presales Emails\nPresales emails are targeted communications sent to specific accounts at defined consideration stages. They are often persona-specific and primarily video-first in format.\nTheir purpose is to:\nRe-ignite dormant but previously engaged accounts\nDeepen engagement among MQLs\nPrime accounts ahead of SDR outreach\nG) Conversation Ads (Regional Activation)\nIn specific regional contexts, conversation-based paid formats are used to:\nPrime high-fit ICP accounts\nSupport specific regions for sales engagement\nEncourage direct meeting or demo engagement\nH) Website Chatbot\nThe website chatbot acts as a structured navigation and engagement tool.\nIts objectives are to:\nGuide visitors efficiently toward relevant product areas\nSurface key information quickly\nProvide a pathway to demo requests or direct contact\nIts\nbranching logic\nsupports progression from early exploration to structured engagement, reducing friction in the discovery phase.\nI) ROI Calculator\nAn\ninteractive ROI framework\nis made available to allow prospects to estimate potential operational and financial impact of platform adoption.\nThis tool:\nSupports value quantification during middle and advanced stage exploration\nStrengthens business-case discussions\nReinforces product positioning through measurable outcomes"

    "level": "2.1.4.2",
    "text": "Customer Support\nPurpose\nProvides assistance to customers post-purchase, ensuring they can effectively use the software and resolve any issues that arise.\nSupport Workflow\nWitboost does not rely on 3rd-parties to deliver professional, educational nor product support services to our customers either. All support services are provided by Witboost employees from Europe.\nFor Witboost, the support workflow is managed on Jira with dedicated boards for each customer. The support team is responsible for managing the tickets and ensuring that they are resolved within the agreed-upon SLA. The customers can see the status of their tickets and communicate with the support team through the Jira platform.\nProblem Identification\nProblem identification means the notification of a problem. The problem should be understood in the best way possible before work can start to fix it. Problems are generally identified in one of two ways: either through a Jira ticket opening from an end-user, or the end-user can ask the Professional Services team to handle the ticket for them.\nTicket Creation\nWhen creating a ticket on Jira, the problem should be described in detail to be analyzed and solved.\nUsually, a Jira ticket contains the following details:\nA name that represents the error;\nThe description, that should contain the overall problem: how to reproduce it, what kind of limitations are related to it, what is the expected behavior, etc;\nImpact of the problem (extensive, significant, moderate, etc);\nUrgency of the ticket as perceived by the customer;\nAffected Witboost version and components.\nAfter the ticket has been taken into charge, the ticket status will be updated by the support team, along with:\nComments, questions, and notes;\nResolution details;\nLink to other similar tickets.\nCategorization\nTicket categorization helps routing to the right resolution team and saves much time in troubleshooting.\nThe reporter opens a ticket with a specific type, chosen among:\nTicket Type\nDescription\nIncident\nImpacts heavily the functionalities of Witboost: i.e. users are no able to use any of the major functionalities\nBug report\nThere are one or more problems while performing some operations, that do not prevent users from using Witboost\nGet IT help\nQuestions, improvements, new features, etc.\nAfter the ticket is opened, the support team proceeds with the categorization (optionally by changing its type) and adds relevant details.\nPrioritization\nThe support team determines the ticket's priority based on the urgency and priority specified by the ticket reporter and assesses its overall impact. This impact is generally aligned with the fault's severity, which is evaluated by considering factors such as service downtime, the number of users affected, and the frequency of the issue, among others.\nBelow is a summary table of prioritization, taking into account impact and urgency:\nInvestigation & Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis step is crucial for identifying and understanding the problem.\nThis step involves collecting all relevant information about the incident and this may include log records, monitoring data, user reports and all other pertinent information.\nTo avoid time-consuming conversations, the ticket should contain all the evidence and tests the reporter performs; in case of missing information, the support team will ask for it to the customers, but this could lead to a delay in the resolution.\nAll activities carried out are tracked directly on the Jira ticket. This provides feedback to the customer on ongoing activities and is needed to align other team members on what has been done and/or discovered.\nEscalation\nIf the diagnostic step does not lead to an immediate resolution or if the ticket requires additional resources or expertise, an escalation is performed.\nEscalation involves escalating the incident to a higher level of support or a specialized team for more advanced resolution.\nResolution & Recovery\nResolution and recovery are performed once the problem is fully understood. Finding a resolution to an incident means that a way of rectifying the issue has been identified. The ticket’s assignee will be responsible of communicating how the resolution will be delivered to the customer: e. g. configuration changes or the release of a new patched version.\nClosure\nAfter completing the steps outlined above, the ticket can be considered resolved and closed.\nA follow-up with the customer is conducted to ensure that the resolution is satisfactory, and if confirmed, a patch release is issued in case the problem is related to a bug.\nThe workflow is outlined below:\nService Level Agreements\nThe Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between Witboost and a customer that defines the specific level of service expected, including measurable performance indicators such as response times, resolution times and availability standards.\nThe SLA outlines the responsibilities of both parties, sets expectations for service delivery and details what happens if these expectations are not met, often including penalties or compensations.\nThe activities and features that are included in the Subscription Fee are:\nProduct components features: non-exclusive and free license for the period during which the subscription shall be provided for all Witboost’s IP components (first release)\nEvolutionary features: non-exclusive and free license for the period during which the Subscription shall be provided (Witboost’s IP components additional releases)\nSecond-level support ticketing service (via Jira ticketing service). This support is provided 8 hours per day, 5 day per week from 9 a.m - 1 p.m and 2 p.m - 6 p.m CET/CEST\nCorrective maintenance (bug fixing)\nUpdates service (to adapt for instance to infrastructure major changes)\nThe perimeter of all the services is the Witboost IP Components (templates and plug-ins are excluded).\nOnly for\nincidents\nand\nbugs\n, the response and resolution times are defined in every contract, based on priority, as outlined in the table below:\nLevel\nDescription\nSLA\nP1 - Critical\nTaking charge of blocking tickets\nwithin 1 hour\nP1 - Critical\nUpdate\nevery 4 hours\nP2 - Serious\nTaking charge of non-blocking tickets\nwithin 2 hours\nP2 - Serious\nUpdate\nevery day\nP3 - Medium/Low\nTaking charge on non-critical questions\nwithin 48 hours\nP3 - Medium/Low\nResolution\naccording to estimate"

    "text": "Product Management\nPurpose\nProduct management involves defining the product vision, strategy, and roadmap. It ensures the product meets market needs and aligns with the company's overall goals.\nKey Processes\nMarket Research and Analysis: Gathering insights about customer needs, market trends, and competitive landscape.\nProduct Roadmap Planning: Defining the product's direction, key features, and timeline for development.\nRequirements Gathering and Prioritization: Working with stakeholders (customers, sales, marketing, engineering) to gather and prioritize product requirements.\nBacklog Management: Maintaining and refining the product backlog, ensuring that the development team focuses on the highest-value features.\nProduct Vision\nThe Product vision is resumed and updated into a MOU ( Memorandum of understanding ) document. This is a live document, evolving time by time according with our evolution in the market.\nThis document has the following structure and is available in the Witboost sharepoint:\nProduct Vision\nProduct Strategy\nProduct principles\nUser Personas\nGo to Market Strategy\nHigh level roadmap\nProduct Roadmap\nWe embrace outcome-based roadmap, and it means that the roadmap focuses on solving business problems instead of being just a list of features. We love this approach because it is really result oriented and it is aligned with other practices we adopt within the company, like OKR.\nThe items of the roadmap have not due dates, we only group them based on their outcome and with a general timeline. We aware that up-front plans never work in our world, and also we want to be free to discover and learn new things along the path and change business priorities based on this.\nWe rely on high integrity commitments and positive intents. The team is always doing its best to accomplish the goal, but in case it fails no drama, it is just another opportunity to learn something new about the process. Product management is about learn and discover, by definition an uncertain process, let's deal with that.\nOur roadmap has always a key goal, something that we want to enable for the customer, and that is our North Star. It is totally useless to define a roadmap for more than a quarter, because product management it is simply too unpredictable and we don't want to loose the opportunity to bring great value and innovation for our customers, because we already promised a specific roadmap for the next 12 months.\nAfter the team brainstorming and the discovery activities, the product manager is accountable to take the final decisions related to the roadmap and commit it with customers and stakeholders.\nThe roadmap should be accessible to the whole team and it is important to notify the whole team when something is changing at that level (not at backlog level).\nThe main tool where the product manager work on the roadmap is Miro. After defining the key goals and capabilities in the \"MOU\" product document, the full flow is developed in Miro according with several best practices.\nOur roadmap is data driven so the first phase is data collection. This happens along the way through several sub-processes:\ncustomer interviews\n: periodically we interview our customers to collect experiences, needs and ideas. When interviewing a customer the product manager is not interested in the solution, but in the underlying pain-point and motivation. Customer interviews are organized by the professional services or customer success, to easily connect the product manager and the customer. During these interviews also the product designer and the product dev lead participate to better get flavours and specific elements. All the customer interviews are written into a specific miro section \"customer interview\"\npre-sales interaction\n: the product manager must be strongly connected with pre sales process because it is important to discover what prospects are looking for in their strategic journey. This is especially important to be able to sense what the market requires and how our value proposition can support it. All the insights and opportunities collected during demo and prospect interactions are written into a specific miro section \"prospect interactions\"\nindependent study\n: continuously understanding the market needs by studying and participating at conferences\nfeature requests\n: all customers and professional services can create a feature request with a specific Form. These requests are periodically reviewed by the Product Manager, filtered and moved into the feature backlog on Miro\ncustomer and market surveys\n: once a quarter we submit a survey to our customer and prospects to better know their priorities. All these information are then moved into Miro\nAfter collecting these data, we enter in the data processing phase, with the following phases:\nConversations to opportunities\n: All the conversations are processed in order to cluster insights and opportunities in \"Pains\" and \"Delights\", basically to understand what is painful for the customer and what would delight the customer. The obvious goal is to identify opportunities to improve the product.\nMap opportunities to the product vision\n: A good product should not solve every kind of problem the customer has, but only those that are aligned with the strategic vision of the product. To do this we adopt the Opportunity Tree method. In Miro there is a specific section for the opportunity tree. This is representing as a tree the business outcomes that we want to achieve with the product (e.g. \"Increase the number of users in each Witboost installation\"), then under each business outcome we map the product outcomes useful to reach the business outcome (e.g. \"reduce the friction for data consumption from new users\"). Under the product outcomes we map the opportunities that can move the product towards the product outcome (e.g. \"I need to understand where the data is before consuming the data\"). Now that the opportunity tree has been created we can try to map solutions, ideas and features requests into these opportunities to create value. If a feature request cannot be mapped in the opportunity tree means we should not develop that feature. Very often the Product Manager has hard times in deciding what to not develop, instead of deciding what to develop.\nFeatures progressing\n: If a feature or solution can be mapped into the opportunity tree, then we can progress with the rest fo the flow before deciding to develop it. The feature need to go through the following phases:\nBrainstorming and early validation\n: the feature is evaluated with the team to understand where it can fit and have a first idea of feasibility, viability and desirability\nPrototype and Discovery\n: if it is a complex one we always try to build a prototype first. The prototype can be only a static design or it can be an implemented one. The prototype has the goal of acquiring more information about feasibility, viability and desirability. With a prototype is possible to ask feedbacks to customer and prospects without the risk of misunderstandings. Also implementing a prototype will provide more confidence to the team about the feasibility of the feature itself for the real implementation\nValidation\n: Lot of good ideas, in line with our strategy stop their journey here because maybe they don't bring too much value. When we have a good set of solutions in the validation stage we run the validation process typically involving customers with survey and interviews, or by collecting feedbacks from the wide market. A feature that is worthy to be developed must add enough value to the overall customer perception. We use the Kano model to do this evaluation.\nAll the features we want to validate are scored based on importance and satisfaction and the relative value that each feature can add to the customer perception. We focus always on top-right corner ( High Opportunity Area ). This process happens on Miro as well.\nPrioritization\n: After a set of features are validated, we need to prioritize them. For this we use the  \"Impact vs Effort Matrix\" framework. We estimate the effort needed to implement a feature and we compare it with the perceived impact for the customer. After this we prioritize in order \"Easy Win\" --> \"Big Bet\" --> \"Incremental\" and we skip \"Money Pit\". Because our current market fit phase we tray to stay away also from incremental and take risk towards \"big bet\". After this step we have the feature backlog, prioritized for the development team.\nThis process is continuously repeated based on new opportunities, ideas or market scenario changes. We don't want to stick to the plan, we want to fit the market.\nThe roadmap is then an emerging picture from this process. When we have the features validated and prioritized, we go back into the opportunity tree and we understand which strategic goal we are targeting the most."

    "text": "People Growth\nCaring about people growth is one of the key elements of Agile Lab to be successful.\nMaking people advance in their career path is a valuable iteration of everyone's professional life and, it contributes to our growth as humans as well.\nThere are many ways to make people grow and here we will discuss how Agile Lab cares about\nagilers\n.\nUltimately, the responsibility for one's career path lies with the individual team member, not the coach. The coach can facilitate, assist, and advocate for it, but each person is ultimately responsible for their own growth. You must take ownership of your career path; promotions will not materialize out of thin air or solely because of your coach's influence. See\nOwning your career\nsection to know more.\nThe framework\nThe people growth framework is based on 4 key elements:\nThe Career Ladder\n: a reference framework outlining professions and areas of competence to support the definition of career paths.\nManagement policies\n: the means that consistently guide choices regarding personnel and organizational needs.\nSegmentation\n: Processes for segmenting the company's population, which allow the identification of targets for designing targeted actions in management, development, and training.\nThe Leadership Model\n: that promotes and values the set of skills necessary to address the challenges of the continuously evolving competitive environment, representing an interpretation of the company's strategy and values and serving as a guiding compass for the daily behaviors of everyone. See\nLeadership\nsection.\nThe framework is also defined by a development process unfolding throughout the entire professional lifecycle of resources and is characterized by several phases aimed at supporting growth with distinctive tools and methodologies for each of them.\nAssess and Intercept\n: It's the phase of the process that allows both the assessment of the level of possession of skills, abilities, performance, and potential of individuals, identifying the best ones, and the planning of targeted actions for professional and managerial development. It also ensures the definition of succession plans for effective coverage of organizational positions, functional to achieving company goals.\nThis phase is a continuous process happening at first between the coachee and the coach during\n1-1\nmeetings where one of the key topic is the growth. Each coach keeps track of agenda and conversations.\nThen twice a year we have the\n360 review\nthat is an important moment to exchange feedbacks and do retrospective. 360 reviews are tracked on Sharepoint.\nDevelopment\n: It is the phase of the process in which the Company operates - through the application of tools, methodologies and approaches - to support and accompany individuals in the journey of acquiring knowledge, technical skills, and abilities that optimally fit their role and/or prepare them for growth into more challenging and complex roles. It acts on engaging individuals in their development, aligning their attitudes and aspirations with contextual needs and opportunities as well as career paths, promoting the implementation of specific Individual Development Plans tailored to different types of impact.\nAlso the development phase is a continuous one and it is happening during\n1-1\nmeetings. In alternative there could be pivotal moments where specific development actions will be taken to prepare for new challenges, roles or contextual situations. The development phase happens in the context of the ladder climbing and documented by the brag file.\nSee\nGrowth Development.md\nto know more.\nReward and Motivate\n: It is the process phase aimed at rewarding performance and critical competencies, involving people, guiding their behaviors, and determining positive effects on both individual and company performance.\nThe reward phase happens twice a year thanks to the\nSalary Review\nprocess where are explained all the principles, steps and roles involved. Also the ladder promotion event is part of this phase of the overall framework.\nAll these steps are tracked on Sharepoint\nEngage and Communicate\n: It is the process phase that promotes continuous action of information, listening, and engaging with people, aimed at keeping their active participation in corporate life and strengthening their sense of identity and belonging.\n1-1\nmeetings again are the right place where engagement and communication should happen.They occur every two weeks to keep these frequent and consistent.\nGovernance\nIn the people growth framework there are mainly two roles involved:\nCTO\n: It is responsible for the maintenance and evolution of the framework itself.\nCoach\n: Everyone in Agile Lab has a reference coach that is responsible for the execution of the process:\nAssess\nDevelopment\nReward\nEngage\nThe coach can be a Team Leader (a team can be splitted in sub-teams), a BU lead or an Engineering Director. The coach is responsible for the growth of a set of people he works directly with. The coach should the best equipped people to run the growth framework process. The coach tipically is a person with higher or equal ladder level than his/her coachees.\nIf a person feels has no assigned coach, need to escalate immediately the situation, because this is a crucial condition to growth within the company.\nEngineering Director\n: Run the execution of 360 review and salary review processes to coordinate with all the coaches and to plan development and reward phases. Take care of properly tracking the process execution, deadlines and results. Engineering director acts as a coach for BU Leads and take the final decision on salary raises.\nHow the framework evolve\nEveryone in Agile Lab can propose modifications and improvements to the framework leveraging the Handbook to make these proposals and conversations transparent, triggering discussions. The final approval of this Handbook section is on the CTO.\nEvery change in the Handbook is versioned, tracked and communicated to the whole company automatically. \nIn case of relevant changes the CTO sends a formal comunication to the whole company explaining the changes and pointing to the merge request."

    "section": "People Growth",
    "level": "2.2.1",
    "text": "The Engineering Ladder is our way to provide people a professional growth path. \nWhat is needed to advance to the next level and get a promotion is well explained and explicit (transparency).\nOur Path is composed of seven levels. The first four are the same for everyone, while the last three are different for tech and manager tracks, as shown in the PDF below.\nFull Screen PDF\nThe Engineering ladder is not related to self-management roles. Self-management roles are needed by the organization, while each individual requires ladder levels to grow as a professional. It helps to develop skills across four main directions:\nDex - Technical skills\nStr - Get Stuff Done\nWis - Impact\nCha - Communication & Leadership\nThe extended document is located in BigData Sharepoint / Career Ladder and it will be updated and releases every six months by the\nrole:Engine/COO\nThis ladder was built taking inspiration mainly from the \"rent the runaway\" ladder and many others. Thanks\nRules\nExpectations at each level are cumulative\nManagers have the same expectations as individual contributors to the extent that they are doing individual work, in addition to manager-specific expectations\nDex and Str ( the «adder» attributes) are the primary drivers of promotions at lower levels. At higher levels, the \nimportance gradually shifts to Wis and Cha ( the «multiplier» attributes )\nNot everyone will progress in each column in lockstep. If you are Eng4 for Dex and Eng2 for Cha, you will not be stuck at Eng2, but you will likely not be promoted all the way to Eng4.  Higher levels require full compliance.\nTo advance to the next level, you need to consistently perform at that level for some time (6M – 1Y) and then \nneeded by the organization\nOnce hired, the assigned level cannot reviewed without doing the process ( including the previous point ), so it will require a minimum of 6M - 1Y to consistently perform at the next level.\nIt is not possible to bump two or more levels in one shot\nTo reach Engineer 3, a positive experience as Project/Team leader is helpful\nPay attention to senior traits and quotas to advance to L3+​\nTo reach Engineer 4 or above, an extensive experience as project/team leader is almost mandatory\nEach level has a compensation range associated. If you are stuck in a level, you can anyway move forward your compensation, but only up to the upper limit.\nLadder levels are not applied to external consultants hired by other companies. Those hired remotely (E2 contracts) are instead included in the ladder mechanism. See\nContracts\nfor details.\nFor higher levels, it is not sufficient to demonstrate skill but is necessary to act consistently, generating a tangible impact. Very often is not possible to create such an impact without having the possibility to serve in specific roles. We don't want people doing activities for ladder climbing and not for the company's needs.\nIn order to move from Engineer Rookie to Eng 1 the coach approval is sufficient.​\nEach level has a minimum working experience requirement ( years ). Minimum working experience is just an hard gate. There are no upper limits in ladder levels. It is possible to remain forever in a level; no improvements, no promotion.\nNot all the people can be promoted to the higher levels.\nRetention Pack is a one time payment delivered at 31/03 of each year. The employee as of 31/03 must still be within the company and employed for more than one year. Retention Pack is only for employees ( E1, E2 )\nRoles above Eng4 ( Ex. Engineering Manager and Staff Engineers ) must have E1 contract\nEach level has an intersection matrix with company roles\nA level with an * means that before being considered fully at that level there is some weakness to fix. The * can be assigned only after the hiring process, not during the normal evolution in the company\nAfter a level has been assigned during the hiring process, the next level must be demonstrated in the context of Agile Lab ( no past experiences will be considered )\nSome level has specific needs based on the technical specialization. The ladder is suitable for the following macro-specializations:\nDE: Data Engineer: Create and industrialize Data Platforms or Data centric use cases\nDS: Data Scientist: Create and industrialize ML based use cases, fitting them in a broader picture and ecosystem\nDA: Data Analyst: Perform ad-hoc analysis, reporting, dashboards and light data transformations / data modelling\nFS: Full Stack Engineer: Creates Microservices, API or end-to-end Web Applications.\nSRE: Site Reliability Engineer: Monitor, Automate and Manage infrastructures and applications\nIt is not necessary to strictly fit on one of these profiles, cross-functionality is a value, and for example we can evaluate an Eng3 for both DE and DA, weighting the evaluations\nOn the Product side, expectations are the same for lower levels, but for the complexity we need to manage at the moment, upper levels are not necessary and targeting consulting only. ( This will be reviewed in the future )\nTech Skills Assessment\nAll capabilities in the tech skills section must be contextualized and weighted according to the specific tech profile. For example, “effective debugging techniques” should reflect your ability to identify and resolve problems. This could apply to fixing a software bug, resolving overfitting in a machine learning model, or scaling a data pipeline.\nNot all competencies must be demonstrated in the brag file—some will be evaluated during the committee review (e.g., “industry trend awareness”).\nValues and Culture\nAlignment with company values and culture is a prerequisitefor promotion at every level. This includes:\n* Practicing self-management, show up prepared and pro-active to improve the organization\n* Prioritizing participation in tactical and governance meetings.\n* Being timely in 360° reviews.\n* Conducting regular 1-on-1s.\n* Engaging in internal surveys.\nAt higher levels, these behaviors are even more critical to set a positive exampleand demonstrate leadership by example.\nPost Recruiting\nNot possible to re-evaluate the result and ladder placement of the hiring process before 3 months\nAfter 3 months there is a formal ladder confirmation process where the candidate is not involved\nThe coach and the interviewer go through an assessment to re-evaluate the original ladder positioning. The following things can happen:\nLadder level confirmed: nothing changes and the candidate need to climb the ladder\nLadder level down-grade: the ladder level remains the same but with an *. In order to clear the *, the candidate need to wait the coach confirmation without doing a formal ladder climbing\nLadder level up-grade: New ladder level assigned and RAL adjusted if needed\nIn case of down-grade the coach and the interview need to explain clearly which are the points not matched on the ladder, providing clear direction and guidance on how to fix that. Remember the ladder level need to be fair for the community, at individual level you need to focus on the improvement journey\nIt is not possible to do a down-grade without previous negative feedbacks and coaching tips, along the 6 previous months coaching journey\nPromotion philosophy\nWhen is possible we approach things to bottom-up and with self-responsibility in mind.\nPromotions are based on actual and consistent performances, not growth potential\n. In order to be considered for a promotion the candidate should be executing at the next level prior to promotion.\nThe promotion is just a milestone in a long-term journey and it is the result of a growth process in partnership with the coach. Personal growth should be a frequently discussed item during 1-1 meetings, without creating the false expectation that because talking about growth then it means we are close to the next milestone. The coach should be super transparent in dealing with team member expectations, performances and improvements.\nWithout consistent improvements and next ladder level performances, there will not be promotion\n, no matter how long the team member is stuck in a ladder level. Fitting with the minimum working experience required for a specific ladder level is not an indication to be eligible for that level,\nthe past working years are not a driver for the promotion\n.\nHow to get promoted\nIf you want to be promoted, you need to assess yourself and convince your coach that you are ready\nAsk your coach to assess with the Consulting Engineering Director or Witboost Lead Link if there is quota into the next level and then present your candidacy sending an email to the upper lead link. They will prioritize requests in case of multiple applications for a level that has no enough capacity. Within the candidacy you can attach your brag file or other kind of documentation that is demonstrating your target level.\nYour coach  will mentor you along the process, helping to build the brag file to support your pitch\nPitch will be done to a specific committee.\nif your mentor is not coaching you enough, please keep him/her accountable\nBy default, the coach is your project leader (or the lead link).\nHowever, project leaders and lead links can delegate the coaching responsibilities to other team members they consider suitable for the role to ensure optimal coaching in the long term.\nThe coach has a huge responsibility in this process:\nif a candidate is not ready to apply for the next level and the coach does not detect it, it can cause a huge demotivation effect in case it is not promoted\nIf a candidate is ready, but is not self-confident to apply for the promotion, could be demotivating as well because no-one is recognizing its value\nCoach must be super transparent and should always coach to reach the goal, but should not to sponsor a not ready candidate.\nWhen to get promoted\nThe candidate can apply to pitch at the beginning of each quarter within a two weeks window, and the candidacy must be presented at least one month before. \nFor example if you want to pitch at the beginning of April (End Q1), the application must be done before the end of February.\nThe brag file\nNot all the people in the committee are aware of what the candidate is doing and how she/he is performing. The ladder is composed by a list of expectations that the candidate needs to fulfill. Most of them are soft or not easy to demonstrate in an interview, so the candidate should build a brag file with its major achievements and how these are fulfilling the ladder requirements. It is also a matter of transparency.\nThe brag file should be a sharable document and it must be shared with the committee at least one week before the pitch, so they can prepare questions and can have a clear overview about it.\nThe document should be self-explanatory and should demonstrate that candidate is acting at the target level since 6-12 months with consistency. Put focus on generated impact and major achievements, the brag file should not be more than 5 pages/slides and should not require more than 40 hours of work ( you can use working hours to prepare your brag because it is a crucial part of your personal growth ). Working hours used for the brag file have to be tracked on the Elapseit project\nPeople Growth\n. The side goal of the brag file is to raise awareness in the candidate, identify weak points and improvement paths.\nEspecially for higher levels, it is crucial to focus more on impact and outcomes than actions and self-referential items. For example, don't report \"I created a new process for code reviews\" without mentioning the positive impact of code review effectiveness and the level of adoption of this new practice within the company.\nBecause not all the ladder requirements can be documented the coach can certify for the candidate that he/she is compliant ( possibly with a cover letter ) or the committee can decide to ask questions about a specific topic to properly assess it.\nPromotion Committee\nWe want to distribute the accountability and don't let a single person judge for a promotion, limiting the judgment bias and the candidate's frustration against a single person.\nThe following roles will compose the committee:\nThe Consulting Engineering Director or Witboost Lead Link plus two other components ( choosen by first one ) (at least Eng 4.)\nThe candidate's coach (project leader/lead link)\nthe lead link of the candidate's coach (upper lead link)\n2 team members (or former team members) of the candidate, chosen by him/her. (if you are not in the position to pick up two team members, explain why and proceed anyway)\nWhen a candidate want to schedule the pitch, the coach will ask the lead link of Consulting or Witboost to compose the committee and schedule the pitch.\nHow to propose an application\nThe lead link of the candidate's coach:\nCalls for a meeting to compose the Promotion Committee sending an email to the Lead Link of Consulting or Witboost and two eligible other members at her/his choice\nPuts the candidate and her/his Coach in cc and attaches brag file and presentation\nAdditionally, can anticipate the two members chosen by the candidate in cc\nThe lead link of the candidate's coach is also responsible to schedule the meeting taking into account everyone's availability.\nThe Coach answers with a cover letter for the candidate.\nThe period between the application and the meeting with the Promotion Committee will be used by the Committee members to review the material and provide further inputs before the presentation.\nThe Pitch\nThe pitch is a meeting among peers, it is not an interview but the committee will ask questions about the brag file or will assess open points. The pitch and the brag file should focus only on expectations points that coach or the committee think must be proven.\nAfter the pitch of the candidate, the committee will express an evaluation in the following way:\nTechnical Skills: coach + two senior engineers from Consulting/Witboost circle (at least Eng 4)\nGet Stuff Done: coach + team members\nImpact: coach + upper lead link\nCommunication & Leadership: coach + upper lead link + team member\nTo get the promotion on each feature, you need to reach unanimity and the result will be given immediately after the pitch.\nIf you get not promoted, you will receive extended feedback about motivations and what you should focus on to get there.\nCompensation\nThe\ncompensation\nmust always be decided by a person that is possibly two levels ( of the ladder) above the promotion's candidate's target level, during the salary review process.\nAfter a promotion process the compensation is reviewed and adjusted, and the salary increase takes effect starting from the following month, in line with the same principles but outside of the scheduled review cycle.\nLadder Governance\nThe ladder is governed by the CTO that is responsible for:\nAdapting the ladder level compensation ranges to stay competitive and pay top of our reference market\nModyfing the ladder level definitions aligning them to what is important to drive the growth of the company\nThe ladder can be modified in every moment, because a crucial steering mechanism to stay competitive in the market, with the following process:\n1) CTO creates a new version of the ladder and publish it in the BigData Sharepoint, where we keep the full history of this document\n2) CTO sends a company comunication to notify the change\n3) CTO updates this Handbook page to make the change transparent also to the external world\n4) CTO detects needed salary raises in case of compensation range modifications and communicate them to HR, as a normal salary raise\n5) HR modifies all the open job positions to align them to the new compensation ranges and expectations\nThe CTO run periodically discussions with Engineering Director and BU Leads to understand if ladder level definitions are matching the company needs.\nCompensation ranges\nThese ranges are calculated by the CTO taking in consideration the following criteria:\nThe percentage of success in hiring people at each specific level relying on the level compensation range. The CTO analyzes the hiring proposal records to define if Agile Lab is competitive or not in the job market\nInvestigation on Glassdoor and other information sources about compnesation ranges for specific job titles\nAll these information are tracked and versioned periodically.\nRisk Management\nLosing people or not being able to hire them for Agile Lab is a consistent risk. The CTO is responsible to manage this risk and keep the company competitive from a salary standpoint. The Ladder has also the goal of creating better alignment between what the company needs and what people focus on for their career progression. Any misalignment on this, could be an high risk for Agile Lab to stay competitive in the market and to be efficient in terms of peopl-job"

    "section": "People Growth",
    "level": "2.2.2",
    "text": "Compensation principles\nnot applied to consultants and contractors\nCompensations in Agile Lab are based on the following principles:\nPay top of our\nreference market\nNo speculation on people's cost of life (family situation, residence region, etc.) or other factors (gender, age, etc.)\nInternal\nfairness\n, everyone should\nfit into the ladder\n.\nThe\nsalary review process\nhappens every six months because people continuously increase their skills and capabilities, and their compensation must follow accordingly.\nA salary review is a company-wide process necessary to guarantee fairness\n, there is neither speculation nor negotiation and\nno one should expect a salary increase at every salary review\n.\nReference Market\nOur reference market is defined by where our customers are based because our revenues strictly depend on this factor. If we mainly work with Italian customers,\nour \"reference market\" is Italy for salaries\n. When we shift our customer base towards other countries, we will adjust the compensations accordingly.\nWhen possible, during the recruitment process (typically after we made our proposal), we collect information about the previous compensation of people we are interviewing to gain a 360 view of the market based on roles and seniority.\nTop of the market\nAt the same time, we measure the effectiveness of our hiring proposals to understand if we are paying top of the market.\nIf we can satisfy candidates in at least 80% of the cases with our proposals, we are on the right path.\nAll our proposals should be compliant with ladder ranges, and as soon we detect that our offers are not compelling anymore, we are falling behind the market. \nIn that case, the ladder and its ranges will be reviewed, and this will positively affect all the people currently employed in Agile.\nFairness\nWithin each ladder level, we evaluate if people's compensations are balanced and if they are a good mirror of their performances, impacts and contributions.\nBecause new people are coming into the picture each semester, it is essential to re-evaluate the fairness across all the people with the same frequency.\nSalary and Ladder relationship\nWithin each ladder level, we have a salary band. We have a band for each level because it is impossible to be 100% fair and objective every moment we observe the ladder. The positioning of a person in the salary band may not always be a direct proxy of their positioning within the ladder level, and thus the closeness to a promotion.\nIt's hard to assess real capabilities and impact of a person only through the hiring process. Mistakes are possible, leading to one of the following scenarios:\nA person is hired with salary at the\nhigh end of the\nEng3\nsalary band\n. Their skill level is\nfar from being considered for a promotion\nto Eng4.\nA person is hired with salary at the\nlow end of the\nEng3\nsalary band\nbut their skill level is\nclose to being considered for a promotion\nto Eng4.\nWhy can the first scenario present itself? Here's an example: To support our business, we may need to hire a person with Eng3 skills that has already a salary at the high-end of the Eng3 salary band. In this situation, we can only hire this person by offering a salary in the high-end Eng3 salary band. Even if we are aware this is a deviation, we may really need to hire a given person to support our business.\nOne of the scenarios above may present itself during the earlier stages of your career in Agile Lab. If this is your case, we expect that the next promotion will bring you in a position where your skill and salary level are aligned. Our\npromotion process\nguarantees salary and ladder level are eventually consistent in terms of fairness.\nEach person has their history, past salary, seniority, and\nperformances\nthat must be considered. What we value is the trajectory, so if a person is making\nsignificant improvements\n, they will have the proper reward in terms of\nsalary increase\n. No significant improvements, no salary increase.\nSalary review process\nInvolved roles\nBU Lead\nEngineering Director\nAccountabilities\nSalary increases are proposed by the Business Unit lead links or in fall back (if the person is not part of a BU) by the Engineering Director. Anyway in case there are not at least 2 levels between the BU lead link and the person that is under evaluation, the review will escalate until we are able to match the difference of 2 level. For example, the Eng 4 salary can't be reviewed by an Engineering Lead, but it should be reviewed by an Engineering Director or the VP of Engineering.\nThe final decision on salaray raise anyway is taken by the Engineering Director after collecting all the evidences and considerations from the BU Leads.\nCriteria\nThe specific person is not involved in the salary review process because we adopt a proactive approach, but in case he/she is not satisfied or there is need for more information, he/she can always reach the person in charge of the review according to previous mentioned rules. Keep in mind that this is not an individual process, and salary review aims also to bring equality across the company, so is not always possible to provide all the information about such process because it is highly sensitive one.\nHow to decide if a salary increase is needed or not?\nNot the case\nThey are not improving\nThey are not engaged\nThey are toxic or negative\nWith a raise they would go above the upper limit of the ladder level range\nshould be considered, but not due\nThey are performing good, showing some improvement, but not consistent\nNot getting a salary improvement since one year or more\nAcquired some specific skills valuable for the company\nIs needed for sure, no doubt, even if they got a raise six months ago\nThey are falling behind the ladder level they belong to\nThey are\nclearly outperforming\nanother person within the same ladder level but with a higher salary\nThey demonstrated a tangible performance boost and authentic engagement since the last raise\nThey are moving consistently towards the next level of the ladder\nThese three blocks should be evaluated in this order. In addition to this every year the Engine Lead Link is defining a cap for salary raises, for example 3% of existing salaries, and all the business units should be stick with such cap.\n▶️ If you want to understand why you got or didn't get a salary increase, you can\ndiscuss this in a\n1:1 session with your coach\n. Don't expect your coach will provide full details about the salary review process. A possible answer could be: \"You're doing great, but for\nfairness\nyou didn't get a raise this time\".\nConstraints\nAt the beginning of the year, the engineering director defines a budget for salary raises, typically a percentage quota ( ex. 4% ) that should be managed for the whole year.\nThe process\n1) Each BU Lead, talking with team leaders, create a proposal for salary raises that is compatible with budget constrains\n2) Each BU Lead discuss the salary raise proposal with the Engineering Director\n3) The Engineering Director take final decision on the salary raise package and communicate to HR to modify the contracts and the employees database\n4) Each BU Lead communicate salary raises to the people\nLadder Promotion\nLadder promotion is completely decoupled from the salary review process that is happening independently\nIn case of promotion, the current salary will be automatically moved to the baseline of the reached ladder level.\nFurther adjustments will be applied if necessary during the salary review. This shall guarantee to fix unbalanced situations during a collective exercise of salary reviews across all the company business units."

It is easier and confortable to tell someone that there is a typo in something they have written than to tell someone their leadership is ineffective because they micromanage, for example.\nTo provide effective feedbacks is important to clearly identify a situation or an experience about the bad behaviour, to highlight the impacts of that and more important to be able to suggest an alternative way to do it differently.\nInstead when you receive feedbacks is important to actively listen without refusing it and more important assume positive intent about the giver, because it is uncomfortable also for her/him.\n1o1 is also an occasion to intercept personal problems and to raise hand about them.\n1o1 should also be a moment where you can be an example to others and reinforce self-management concepts, the team leader should ask if the team member has non-project circle activities and state again that the team member can safely dedicate time to those activities without asking permission. Often a new team member not accustomed to the self-management pratice will still not dedicate time to non-project activities with fear of subtracting time to the project, state clearly that this is something that can be resolved only with communication between project leaders/lead link of other circles/team member and offer help in sorting priorities and state clearly if the project can afford the expected reduction of effort from a team member that works also on other circle activities.\nSkip Level 1o1\nThe Skip Level 1o1 is a mechanism to systematically break barriers. Coaches taking care of other coaches should plan to address 1o1s directly with team members:\nThis opens many opportunities:\nIt allows to interrupt easy bias between coaches and coachees.\nIt provides an occasion for different perspectives\nIt shrinks the coaching chain\nIt is effective to produce feedback for coaches\nIt generates opportunity to accelerate company culture dissemination\nScheduling\n1o1 meeting should be conducted at least once a month and it is suggested to do it bi-weekly.\nAgenda\nIf you have few items on the agenda try the following questions:\nIs there anything that needs clarity?\nWhat are you most proud of/excited about?\nWhat do you like about our culture ? What is your favorite cultural value ?\nWho is the best manager you've ever had ? What did you like about them ?\nHow do you know that you've had a productive day ?\nWhat can I (your manager) improve on?\nAnything you think important that happened since the last 1-1\nWhat are potential troubles you see for the team\nWhat are potential troubles you see for the company\nWhat went well last week?\nWhat went not so well last week?\nIs there anything that is demotivating in you\nWhat are your superpowers ?\nWhat is the best feedback that you've gotten in the last months ?\nWhat is an area that you want to spend more time on that you haven't been able to ?\nIs there a particular role in the company that you'd be interested in learning about ?\nWould you like more or less direction from me ( manager ) ?\nIs there any skills that you'd like to acquire in the sort term ?\nHow do you find working with the team ? Is there anything we can do to improve team culture ?\nAre our meetings a good use of your time ? What can we do to improve them ?\nDo I give you enough feedback ?\nDo you feel like I acknowledge/recognize the positive work that you do ?\nWhat can I do to help you move faster ?\nWhat do you could be useful to share with the company ?\nAre there any software, tool or resource that you think you could benefit from ?\nIs there someone in the company that you think you could learn a lot from? What would you like to learn ?\nWhat is your preferred mode of communication ? Email/Chat/Phone/Other ?\nWhat's something I should consider changing or start doing ?\nWhat are your long-term professional goals ?\nWhere do you get your job satisfaction from ?\nIs there anything I can do to help?\nAnything non-work related worth mentioning?\nWhen x happened, what will you do differently next time?\nHave you identified any career development opportunities that I can help you with?\nWhat are your long-term goals ?\nWhat obstacles will you need to overcome to achieve these goals ?\nDid you think about attending a conference or using an alternative to the conference bonus for your technical growth?\nAre you actively dedicating time to non project circles?\nDo you need my help in deciding to work to a non project circle task subtracting a bit of effort from the project?\nAgile Lab adopts OKR (Objective and Key Result) as a goal-setting framework. Do you know what is it and why it is effective to overtake the company's strategy?\nDo you know there is a proper role called \"OKR Champion\" for any further doubts you could have about OKR?\nAs regards OKR, have you ever been involved in OKR initiatives and brainstorming or would you be like to be? If so, can I help you to find a good balance between project and OKR tasks?"

    "level": "2.2.4",
    "text": "360 Review\nOverview\nIn Agile Lab, after 7 years of performance measurements and many different evaluation systems, we understood that it is really hard to be fair. We value fairness and transparency so we can't live with that.\nAlso, our self-management culture is encouraging people to take accountabilities out of their comfort zone (accept new technical or leadership challenges, work in additional circles, OKR, etc...) but, when it comes to evaluating performance, most of it is coming from project activities, so people could be tempted to maximize their individual performance versus their impact at the company level, and this is something we don't want to happen. It would be the classical example of when an economic incentive is playing against the organization itself, known as the distraction/cancellation effect. \nWe want to value adaptive behaviors, team working and we want people to have an impact at company level. All such behaviors are hard to measure, then it is unlikely that pay-for-performance systems will be fair.\nMoreover, no performance review is happening in Agile Lab and the bonus (economic incentive) is not linked to the individual performance but is, instead, linked to the overall company performance instead.\nWe want people to act at their best because driven by play, purpose, and potential (ref. Total Motivation factor). We want people acting like shareholders, not individual performers.\nThus, at the end of each semester we have anyway the 360 review.\nEveryone in the company can participate.\nThe 360 review process allows everyone to give and receive feedbacks in order to improve. It is called\n360\nbecause the way it is structured helps building a complete view about each of us and collect more useful feedbacks.\nIt is just another way to provide feedbacks, but more structured, and since we value transparency\nit is NOT anonymous and it must be actionable\nin order to improve.\nHonest feedbacks only.\nIt is important to understand that people are not judging you but they are providing feedbacks. These are not right or wrong but they are just feedbacks, please listen to them.\nWhen you provide feedbacks be responsible and owner of what you think and what you say, be candid and be ready to discuss more about your feedback in 1:1 with the specific person.\nProcess\nThe 360 Review process follows these steps:\nCTO starts officially the process\nTwo days for everybody willing to receive feedbacks to clone the form and publish it through the channels (see\nHow to\nsection in this page)\nThen, you have 2 weeks to fill in all the 360s because we want you to take the proper time to think about how to provide feedback and make them insightful for other people. Please, keep track of who wants to have feedback from you, and don't forget about it.\nFinally, each coach starts to discuss them\nFilling the 360 review provides the perfect chance to give your feedback to the company about your learning path progression, if are there impediments, etc.\nWhen you share your review with your coach, please add some personal consideration, self assessment, and whatever you feel could be important to highlight at company level\n360 Review Structure\nWe adopt an open-ended questions approach to stimulate critical thinking, and create the right conditions to provide insightful feedbacks. We don't want to rate or evaluate people, we want just to provide them useful information to own their personal growth within the company.\nThere are three sections:\nCheck-in\n: This is the only mandatory part and providing a instant feedback about it is positive and what can be improved ( Start from positive things because after that is easier to accept negative feedbacks )\nPersonal Development\n: Here there is the possibility to be more specific on how the target person could improve and be more effective within the company\nClosing\n: Saying Thanks and Sorry is always important to create better connection with people and share vulnerabilities. This will make you feedback more effective and accepted.\nIt is highly encouraged to provide feedback to people you worked with during the past semester, no matter if you worked in the same team or you collaborated in a side project or in a circle. The feedback should be based on some interaction with the other person.\nIt is not mandatory to fill all the questions, but highly recommended to take your time and go through them\nAll the suggestions MUST BE actionable\n, be specific, honest and constructive. No blaming.\nNon-actionable\nfeedbacks are, as an example:\n\"stop sending mixed messages on certain issue\"\n\"you are great, I enjoy working with you\"\nThese two non-actionable feedbacks are bad/malformed feedbacks because they are not providing any clue on how the target person can improve.\nActionable\nfeedbacks are, as an example:\n\"you can be overly confident, even aggressive, in advocating for a position. I felt this was the case when you were advocating for facility re-opening. You ask for opinions but it seems you are predetermined to get a certain outcome\"\n\"you don't respond to emails from my team, it feels hierarchical and discouraging. Perhaps we need to establish more trust but I need you be more generous with your time and insights\".\nActionable feedbacks are good feedbacks, even if negative, because it is clear what they are referring , also with specific references and examples, and providing some suggestion on how to improve.\nA good feedback should be given with a positive intent, don't provide feedback in order to get frustration off your chest, intentionally hurting the other person. Address the problem and explain what behavior change could help the company or the individual,\nnot how it could help you\n.\nEach 360 review, when completed should be shared with your coach.\nIt could be really helpful for leaders to share back their 360 evaluations and show to the team their weakness and improvement needs. This will improve transparency ( not mandatory ).\nHow to join a 360 Review process\nWe use Microsoft Forms app to provide a shareable document so that others can give us feedbacks.\nIn order to obtain a 360 Review form you should:\nGo into Sharepoint:\nBigData/Performance review/360 review template.txt\nInside the text file you will find a link. Open the link and click on\nDuplicate It\nto clone the form.\nRename the new form by editing its title. Form name must follow this naming convention:\n360 Review <YYYYMM> - <Name> <Surname>\n(e.g.\n360 Review 202301 - Michael Jordan\n) where\nYYYYMM\nis the current year and date e.g.\n202301\nCreate a shareable link! Click on\nCollect responses\nto create a shareable link.\nNotify all the people you want to get feedback from, or tag them in the file\nAdd the link into the Excel file: \"360 review - yyyy H1/H2\" for better reachability.\n(Optional)\nPost a message in the \"360 review\" channel in Microsoft Teams.\nOnce the 360 Review process gets officially closed. Please share the 360 results with your coach."

    "text": "Leadership & Coaching\nLeadership\nHow does leadership matter with people growth?\nAt Agile Lab, we give\nleadership\nvery much attention.\nLeadership is the ability to influence opinions, decisions, people.\nThere are good leaders and bad leaders. We aim to grow wonderful leaders and this requires an important dose of people growth effort.\nWe excercise our leadership to provide our customers with elite data engineering principles, practices, services, and products.\nWe want our professionals being able to manage complex initiatives, projects and situations while feeling safe and confident about their actions taken with awareness about risks and benefits.\nOur leaders work to growth new leaders and build a community of professionals.\nBuilding leaders means nurturing self-actualization based on a solid methodological, technical, and organizational background.\nOur leaders convey tutorship, mentorship and coaching at many levels.\nWhether behaving as mentors or coaches is inherently situational.\nIt depends on seniority of trainers and trainees, type of activities and accountabilities to make people feel safe with.\nFor this reason, you may find in the handbook the terms mentor, coach and leader used with the same intention: leaders caring about people growth.\nLead Links\nA lead link is in charge of the management of a piece of the organization following our self-management principles as stated in Agile Lab's\nconstitution\n.\nLead links should mentor and coach their circle members with particular attention to\nteam leaders\nsince they are responsible for a whole team and may need more support.\nTeam Leaders\nOur activities are often organized by teams. Every team is assigned to a\nTeam Leader\nresponsible for team members' growth.\nA team is always an important occasion to learn for everyone. Team leaders can learn how to mentor/coach our engineers and engineers can learn by examples from our team leaders.\nUsually this is a mid-long term path where\nagilers\nhave a constant occasion to improve and receive feedback.\nA team leader helps her/his colleagues to ramp up their\ncareer path\nthrough the achievement of goals within and outside the scope of their own projects according to company's objectives and\npurpose\n.\nThis is very important to create alignment between personal/professional expectations and company's objectives.\nMentorship in team working\nThe team leader is not the only mentor within a team.\nIn a team, people having more experience care about younger\nagilers\nto make a team stronger and more effective.\nAn effective team makes everyone improve. People eager to improve makes a team stronger.\nCommunity Of Practices\nAt Agile Lab we have established a\nCommunity Of Practices\nfor\nLeadership & Coaching\nwhere to discuss how to improve our practices for people growth.\nWe aim to grow wonderful leaders:\nActing with awareness, respect and method.\nBeing ambassador of\nAgile Lab's values\n.\nFeeling and acting as\nmentors and coaches\nand striving for continuous improvement.\nBehaving consistently inside and outside the company. We like people that do not fake. If you don't feel your values matching our values this is fair, feel free to leave.\nBeing supportive with respect to each other. We do not leave our colleagues alone. We always share risks, joys and failures.\nFeeling free to disagree, bringing in your opinion, being constructive.\nSeeking truth over cohesion.\nStriving to make the organization simpler.\nActing as servant and gentle leaders. Don't feel a boss, none of us does.\nGood leadership\nManaging under-performance is one of your most important tasks as a manager.\nWhen times are great, be a voice of moderation. When times are bad, be a voice of hope.\nIf you praise someone, try to do it publicly and in front of an audience. If you give suggestions to improve, do it privately 1 on 1.\nUnderstand that there are different ways to get to the same goal. There are different perspectives, and discussions need to happen.\nWhen someone says they are considering quitting, drop everything and listen to them. Ask questions to find out what their concerns are. If you delay, the person will not feel valued and the decision will be irreversible.\nIf you are asked why someone has left or is leaving, please refer that person to the general guidelines section of the handbook where we describe what can and cannot be shared.\nPeople should not be given a raise or a title because they ask for it or threaten to quit. We should proactively give raises and promote people without people asking. If you do it when people ask, you are being unfair to people that don't ask and you'll end up with many more people asking.\nDon't refer to Agile Lab as a family. It is great that our team feels like a close-knit group, and we should encourage that, as this builds a stronger team. But families and teams are different. Families come together for the relationship and do what is critical to retain it. Teams are assembled for the task and do what is required to complete it. Don't put the relationship above the task. Besides, families don't have an offboarding process. Families should have unconditional love, while teams have conditional love. The best companies are supporters of families.\nPraise and credit the work of your reports to the rest of the company, never present it as your own.\nTry to be aware of your cognitive biases.\nCombine consistency and agility.\nDo everything to unblock people. If someone has a question that is keeping them from being productive, try to answer the question yourself or find someone who can.\n\"People either get shit done or they don't. And it's easy to be tricked because they can be smart but never actually do anything.\" Watch for results instead of articulate answers to questions, otherwise you'll take too much time identifying under-performers.\nWe don't have explicit 20% time at Agile Lab. We measure results and not hours.\n\"Always tell us the bad news promptly. It is only the good news that can wait.\" Make sure to inform your manager of bad news as quickly as possible. Promptly reporting bad news is essential to preserving the trust that is needed to recover from it.\nComplain up and explain down. Raise concerns you hear to your manager. When peers or reports complain, explain why a decision was made. If you don't understand why, ask your manager.\nTrain your team and build their confidence until you are in the position to trust them.\nGood/bad team leaders\nGood team leaders:\nfull responsibility and measure themselves in terms of delivery and customer satisfaction.\ndefine their job and their success.\nare resilient, they are able to adapt to mutable scenarios and customer requests.\nestablish good relationship with the customer from day 1.\nclearly define \"what\" instead of \"how\".\nprovide to the team a clear definition of done.\ndon't give direction informally. They gather information informally.\ncommunicate a lot with the customer, understanding and anticipating needs, raising and solving problems with transparency.\nsend their status report frequently because they are organized and disciplined.\nask for help as soon as they need.\nact keeping in mind company's values and processes.\nprovide blameless support to the team.\ncollect and provide feedbacks doing 1-1 meetings and retrospective. Negative feedbacks always in 1-1.\nassume positive intent on team mistakes\nBad team leaders:\nconstantly want to be told what to do\nalways complains about the customer and don't modify their modus operandi\nhave lots of excuses\ncomplain about the team\ndon't follow company guidelines and processes\nCoaches\nA good coach is expected to:\nCreate a development plan with concrete actions\nUnderstand and be familiar with her/his domain and context\nBe positive, make always possible a path for improvement\nBe assertive and goal-oriented\nExcel in clarity and patient\nAsk the right questions, stimulate reasoning\nListen actively and sincerely\nSpend time with coachees, be available, do not make coachees wait forever for guidance\nBe supportive, keep judgements aside\nProvide examples close to the coachees' experiences, otherwise she/he will not be understood\nDo not act on behalf of the coachee, trust coachees\nDo not scratch the surface, be a profound thinker, go to the root of the issues\nBe an observer, explain issues consistently and in depth, do not be superficial and generic with coachees\nShare knowledge and take time to understand how to transfer or create it\nKeep improving on hard and soft skills, keep her/himself up to date, be a beautiful example\nMotivate and energise your coachees\nMotivate through emotions, teach through facts\nStrive for confrontation with other coaches\nDisplay genuine passion and commitment on nurturing colleagues and caring about people growth\nA bad coach:\nDoes not listen carefully to coachees\nProvides rough suggestions\nUses to blame and finger-point\nSpends time talking about her/his stories of success for no reasons\nDoes not trust coachees\nDoes not motivate people or motivation is driven by fake values\nDoes not share knowledge with coachees and coaches\nOther references\nBuddies"

    "section": "People Growth",
    "level": "2.2.6",
    "text": "Owning your career\nOwn it !\nWhy ? Because nobody cares about your careeer as much as you do.\nWhile coaches are eager to assist with team members' careers, they are not the best people to manage them. The most suitable person is the individual themselves. Those who take initiative, set goals, track progress, and continuously improve are best positioned for growth.\nTake ownership of your career if you aim for success. Don't just wait for a coach to intervene. There are plenty of ways to own your career, such as informing your coach and peers about your interests, showcasing your work, and creating opportunities for feedback.\nGet Stuff done\nComplete the tasks assigned to you and deliver high-quality results. Over-deliver when possible and maintain consistency over the long term. More importantly, ensure people are aware of your accomplishments; don't assume your coach and peers will automatically know. Communicate specifically about impactful achievements to your coach and team.\nMaintain a Work Log and make sure it's visible to your coach.\nAsk for feedback\nOne of the best ways to grow professionally is through feedback from colleagues. To get meaningful feedback from peers and your coach, ask about specific situations or tasks (e.g., \"I recently worked on this task, what do you think about my coding style?\" or \"How do you think the strategy meeting went? Were my contributions insightful?\"). Avoid asking for general and vague feedback (e.g., \"How am I doing?\") as it often leads to non-specific responses like \"nothing, everything is good,\" which isn't helpful for your growth.\nHelp your coach to help you\nHave regular one-on-one meetings; request them if your coach forgets to schedule.\nPrepare the agenda and ensure your coach understands your priorities and goals.\nSeek specific feedback.\nDon't assume your coach is aware of all your work. They likely have a lot on their plate too, so help them focus on your context.\nEstablish mutual trust. Be open, honest, and transparent. Share the unvarnished truth without fear of judgment.\nCareer\nDespite the inspiring stories on LinkedIn about people advancing from junior to senior positions in three years, such rapid progression is unlikely at Agile Lab, and we believe you shouldn't be overly concerned with these examples.\nAvoid letting promotions, titles, and salary define you and your self-worth. It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to those at higher levels or in different companies, leading to frustration. Focus instead on your own path. Assess the pros and cons of your current situation and strive to make incremental improvements based on what matters for you; there's no need to rush. Life and career are \"infinite games\" where there are no definitive winners or losers, only those who are \"ahead\" or \"behind.\" However, it's important to remember that the definitions of \"ahead\" and \"behind\" are subjective and based on your own perspectives and expectations.\nBe wary of biases when comparing yourself to others, based on your personal evaluation criteria. Always strive to understand the criteria used by the company.\nIt's easy for a senior engineer to look at a staff engineer and believe they are performing certain tasks better. Resist this urge to compare. Promotions and levels are not solely based on specific skills but also on creating consistent impact for the company when opportunities arise. Opportunities within a company are not always distributed evenly; it's important to accept this.\nValue creation\nIf you're seeking more opportunities and want to create an impact, ask yourself: What does my coach value? What is important for Agile Lab? Set aside your personal priorities and focus on delivering results that are significant to the company.\nConsider what Agile Lab values more: \nConsistently performing and solving concrete problems in challenging projects, or exploring new technical languages? \nDoes a coach prefer team members who autonomously solve customer problems, or those who require their limited time to resolve customer issues? \nDoes Agile Lab value individuals who can create thought leadership in the market and directly impact revenues, or those who focus solely on technical implementations and internal matters? \nIs it more beneficial for Agile Lab to have team members capable of building long-lasting relationships with customers, or those who prefer to switch projects annually? \nDoes Agile Lab prefer individuals who embrace its values and beliefs, or those who oppose them?\nThose who align with the company's and coach's priorities and contribute to the company's value generation will have more opportunities to express their potential and then advancein their path.\nCompensation and promotions are exchanges of value between the company and the employee. The higher the value delivered to Agile Lab, the greater the compensation and advancement. However, what constitutes \"value\" is defined by the company, not the employee. The value all the employees generate is based on the Agile Lab values, goals and market context.\nInvestments pay off later\nNowadays, people often want rapid success, but it's essential to remember that your career might span over 40 years. If you become a Staff Engineer in three years, what progression can you expect in the remaining 37 years? It's realistic to acknowledge that most people won't reach Level 4+ positions. Many tech companies have a \"terminal level,\" meaning \"get promoted or get fired.\" We don't subscribe to this philosophy at Agile Lab, but it indicates that also in other companies not everyone can advance to higher levels. This is acceptable, and we should approach it with serenity and transparency.\nTreat your career as a journey to discover your full potential. Stay curious and don't rush. Sometimes, moving sideways—whether into a new tech stack, a new role, exploring leadership, or accepting new challenges might seem to slow you down in the short term, but it can accelerate your growth in the future. This approach allows you to accumulate more experiences, perspectives, and structure."

    "text": "At Agile Lab we approach people growth in many ways ( see this section ):\nTutorship\n: teaching people new things driving them through a personal path; usually short-term and laser focused on specific topics;\nMentorship\n: mentors lead new\nagilers\nby examples. Mentors are expected to proactively teach things, explain concepts, help resolving issues. \nIn turn, mentees are expected to be eager to learn, proactive asking questions, experimenting, failing to understand and improve.\nCoaching\n: a coach provides direct hints, recommendations, suggestions, feedback. It does not take direct actions on behalf of a coachee.\nTutorship\nPeople growth starts since the first day at Agile Lab.\nEveryone onboarding our company receives an initial tutoring by our\nBuddies\n.\nAt this stage we introduce new employees our culture, practices, tools and all the necessary means to be autonomous working on a daily basis.\nThis is a fundamental part of people growth since this gives everyone an initial taste of our identity and values.\nMentorship\nA mentor follows people growth for a mid-long overlap of their working life. \nMentorship is more directive since mentors know which results to expect from their mentees.\nUsually, mentorship is provided by peer programming, shadowing or any other activities done side-by-side with the mentee.\nMentorship tends to be more directive to address specific problems tries to tackle software design issues, troubleshooting, etc.).\nAnyway, our mentorship style is strongly based on the proactivity of our mentees.\nThus, we expect our\nagilers\nto work at their best and tackle their own issues with professional attitude.\nCoaching\nA coach stimulates people brain, makes her/his colleagues growth giving hints, recommendations, providing feedbacks, and challenging their decisions.\nOf course, our mantra is \"leading by example\". Anyway, coaching should not invade people's space in order to let them learn from their own experiences.\nInstead, coaching means moving the right human and professional levers by sharing thoughts, reasoning together and making the right questions. \nFor instance, a brilliant engineer moving to her/his first project leadership experience may need some initial shadowing (closer to mentorship than coaching).\nAs soon as she/he gets the right grip to move autonomously, coaching comes into play."

The customer has no clear requirements, but it is clear what set of skills are useful to drive the project forward. Tipically the customer has the governance of the project and the overall accountability for the execution.\nOn these projects we expose a rate per day for each professional profile is needed for the project.\nA\nTK ( TurnKey)\nproject instead has a clear definition of done, requirements are well defined or anyway is possible to reach that status. The customer want to reach a specific goal within a certain timeframe and it is not interested in the \"how\" that is not related to the definition of done.In this kind of project we expose the final project cost and an elapsed time for the completion of the project. We also take care of the governance of the project and we become accountable for the overall delivery.\nA TK project for us is more risky than a T&M, because we know in software there is always high percentage of uncertainty. All the risks must be evaluated, covered and priced ( risk coverage ). Possible risks are:\nnot enough clear requirements and definition of done\nunknown technical challenges that can drain time and effort to be solved\nunavailabily of internal resources of the customer to complete mandatory steps for the project completion ( ex. Business involvement for UAT )\nlack of budget or availability to handle change requests ( no matter if small or bigs )\nenvironmental challenges that is not possible to know in advance\nSo, TK projects are tipically more costly for the customer because we need to price governance and risk coverage costs.\nWe love to take risks,be autonoumous and accountable, so we love TK projects.\nOur rules for the customer\nPay attention because some customer will try to obtain the guarantees provided by the TK but at the cost of a T&M. Unfortunately there are no free lunchs :-)\nHere a list of rules we apply during the pre sales phase:\nWe need to define the project type before to start talking about costs and estimates\nBased on the customer briefs and their goals we suggest what is the best project type to achieve them. If customer is asking for a specific project type that is not consistent with goals, we kindly suggest to change it because it can damage the project results and our relationship with the customer.\nWhen it is a TK we never expose man days estimates neither the number of people we are going to use, we only expose project costs and elapsed timeframe for the completion.\nIn order to proceed with a TK project, requirements, deliverables and definition of done must be super clear.\nHow to recognize the customer is trying to cheat you:\nCustomer: \"My procurement is allowing me to do only T&M but I would like to setup TK with you, don't worry about details we will arrange them\". In this case the correct answer would be \"better to do t&m\". Because after you will provide TK economics, you will be forced to expose also estimates and daily rates to satisfy procurement forms. At this stage you will receive challenge on estimates, rates and total project cost. In reality this is just a way to don't let you add the risk coverage quota of the project. In case you will find yourself in this situation, stay calm and explain that governance and risk coverage MUST be paid, you can point them to this page as our internal policy.\nIf you have a pre-existing T&M agreement with specific daily rates and the customer start to ask you to switch on TK, the implicit expectation will be to have the same daily rate, to understand the team composition and man days estimations. But on TK we are playing a different game so don't follow the customer on this reasoning.\nBest project type based on customer goals\nT&M is the most suitable one when customer:\nWants training on the job or team augmentation\nKeeps the governance of the project and prefers to be accountable of the delivery\nSteers the project based on evolving requirements\nDevelops a product from scratch( because product management is evolutionary by definition )\nDoesn't recognize that project governance is an activity that must be paid\nDoesn't recognize that a TK needs to consider risks\nTK is the most suitable one when customer wants:\nReach a specific business goal and:\nnot interested in technical stuff\ndon't have capabilities/skills/time to keep the governance of the project\nDevelop a specific feature/use case that can be well defined also from a technical standpoint as definition of done.\nStep towards the offer\nHere a list of steps before to issue an economic quotation and an offer:\n1) Technical team involvement: Sales or Account will involve the proper BU Lead, based on the business domain the customer is belonging to. The only exception is for product and services that must be redirected to the proper circle leads. The BU lead will involve his/her people and additionally can ask help from people in community of practices. In this step the Sales or Account should brief the technical team about the overall customer context and specific strategies.\n2) High level requirements gathering: The technical team understands what we need to do ( is needed also for the T&M because we need to choose the right people for the right job )\n3) T&M vs TK: You need to understand if the customer prefer a T&M or a TK, and we need to assess if the customer is aware of the difference and it is able to stay consistent with this choice.\n4) (TK) Deadlines: Try to figure out what is the expecation of the customer in terms of due date, if it is possible to have incremental deliverables and due dates. This could be very useful to define the team composition and scaling.\n5) (TK) Evaluation & Feasibility: The technical team estimates the project and assess feasibility. (see next chapter for more details).\n6) (TK) Project cost: The account or sales team convert the estimates into the project cost\n7) (TK) Project explanation: Don't send costs by email, organize a call, explain the offer, the assumptions and the cost structure. Do not talk of team composition, estimates or daily rates in this phase.\n8) (TK) Get informal approval: When you reach this point, inform immediately the BU Lead and COO for proper activities planning\n9) (TK) Send the official offer (this time also by email)\nThe entire process from the initial engament to the offer, shoould not last more than 3-4 weeks. Timing is really important and the technical team must prioritize this activity in the right way.\nEvaluation and Feasibility\nThe technical team must evaluate the request to understand if our company is a good technical fit for that. If the requirement is too high, a deep dive with the customer is needed to understand the request better. In this deep dive, the technical team must be present, don't use the sales team as a bridge. Also, in this phase, it must be clear the definition of done for the customer in terms of expected deliverables.\nThen we have to estimate the effort. The technical team will elaborate on the estimate, and the BU Lead or the COO will review it. Pay attention to include all the possible activities in the estimate because there will not be another window to adjust the offer.\nHere a list of activities that you should consider:\nDevelopment\nTesting ( unit, integration, performance )\nDocumentation\nProject Management/Governance\nInfrastructure setup\nSecurity\nDevOps\nRequirements analysis\nHLD & LLD\nThis list could change based on the list of deliverables requested by the customer.\nGeneral tips to make a reasonable estimate:\nLook at past similar projects and real delivery speed\nTry to weigh the effort on an average level team ( at this time of the process, the team that will implement the project is still not known ), not on your skills.\nIf you are in doubt, add contingency.\nContingency is a very important aspect to cover the uncertainty of the requirements and the speed of the team. It must be added at the end of the process.\nGolden rules for this phase in case of TK:\nNever talk about contingency to the customers ( even if you have a strong relationaship with them), they will try to cut it, but it is needed and fair to have it\nNever talk about daily rates\nNever talk about man day estimates\nSometimes the customer will ask for a TK but the requirement is really weak. In this case the technical team needs to spend time with the customer to gather a better requirement and everything must be written down (we will see it in the offer section).\nIn case the customer has no time or skill to provide a full requirement, don't blame it, we need to guide the process, do the right questions and make assumptions.\nAssumptions are your best friend in these cases, be sure to write them down alongside with the estimates and transfer them in the offer later. They will help to guide the customer in a proactive way and to refine te requirement step by step reaching a good level in the estimate.\nThe estimate must be done in an Excel file, splitting as much as possible the activities and documenting the numbers' reason. Remember that an estimate could be reviewed several years later when nobody will remember the context, and it should be comprehensible.\nThe BU Lead or the COO will try to challenge the estimate from different standpoints before to freeze it and to propose it to the Sales team. When an estimate is frozen, please archive it in an accessible place.\nBased on the expected deadlines and the estimate, the BU lead will assess the feasibility in term of capacity and will define how much time they need to setup the proper team for this project. In case of missing capacity BU Lead in charge of this process will involve also the COO and other BU Leads to figure out if we can retrieve the missing capacity somewhere else. At the end of this phase, the BU Lead and the Account need to decide if he/she want to proceed with an offer or not, based on the overall fit and feasibility.\nAnatomy of an offer\nThe offer for a project should include the following information:\nPreface about the company\nProject type ( T&M or TK)\nProject resume: Explain the business goal of the project and all the requirements, integrating all those have been inferred along the process\nProject solution: Explain the solution we designed (high level) for this project, to let the customer understand that we understood the problem and we already have a specific solution in mind. In this phase it is important to explain all the assumptions we made to estimate the project (without mentioning the estimate), to clarify what is included and what is not in the solution we are pricing\nProject deliverables: Here we introduce the definition of done, setting the expectation for the quality of the delivery, and defining a list of deliverables that are mandatory to consider the project completed.\nProject timeline: Main milestones and elapsed timeframes\nConstrains (here some example):\nAvailability of the customer to run UAT or be part of specific activities that are crucial for the success of the project\nExplicit acceptance that in case there will be need to steer from the original requirement (no matter if small or big change) we can ask for a CR (change request).\nNot solicitation: our employees are not for sale and we want to establish a fair relationship with our customers in bi-lateral way\nPayment terms"

The schedule must be aligned with the main shareholder one.\nOwner of the process\n: CFO\nParticipants\n:\nThe first level circles and specific roles are the participants of this process. When a participant is a circle we involve the Lead Link, when it is a role we involve the direct person.\nIn the specific at the moment of writing the involved stakeholders are:\nShared Services: Finance, People Care, People Hiring and Admin, Compliance, Training, Internal IT\nBusiness Value Streams: Witboost and Consulting.\nProcess\n:\nIn this process there are several phases:\n1) CFO starts the process and create the budget master template where all the data will be collected. At this stage the CFO and the CEO set objectives according with our master plan. The CFO also prepare all the calculations to be able to keep under control all the important parameters: FTE, contracts, revenues, costs, margin, ebitda, etc.\n2) The CFO involve the participants providing the macro numbers they need to stick with and all the relevant informations needed to build the budget. For example if there are variable costs dependent on the number of employees this information must be pre-calculated and provided as input. Tipically the CFO pre-calculates budget numbers projecting the expenses of the ast year to perform a first-level balance of the budget.\n3) All the participants define how they want to split the budget into activities or areas of budget and will provide back the proposed numbers and breakdowns, directly in the CFO template spreadsheet. For example Internal IT will define all the expenses forecasted for the next year and will provide a total sum. Another example instead could be Witboost circle that needs to define how much to spend in R&D, Sales and Marketing. In this phase the participants can decide to involve or not sub-circles to obtain more data.\n4) The CFO can then perform a first simulation and balance of the budget, providing feedbacks and insights to the participants. Once the budget numbers are working, the CFO creates a first freeze of the budget and discuss it with the CEO and other main shareholders\n5) If the numbers get confirmed by shareholders, we enter in the refinement phase.\nAt this stage all the circle can share the numbers to the sub-circles and ask them to define activities aligned with the overall strategy of the circle and the shared numbers. When this iteration is closed, all the numbers must be reported into the master budget to allow fine-grain budget spending monitoring by the Finance circle along the year\n6) In case the shareholders decide to review and refine the overall budget, the process must be repeated until everything is aligned.\nThe fine tuning of the budget must be finished before the end of the year ( but very often the high level figures will be due way before), to be in the positon to create all the information in the systems ( Elapseit, SAP) for monitoring purposes."

In order to manage change and ensure a high quality of products and services, organisations today have to be based on knowledge and skills development. Training is also an essential component of what is called “organisational well-being”.\nFor that reasons HR Circle determines for each year a programme containing the minimum of training hours for all the personnel, including a fix amount of hours concerning compliance and security in general.\nOnboarding training activities will be executed by the relevant Circle taking care of giving all the inscructions concenring compliance and the existance of this Handbook to all new empoyees and personnel in general.\nTraining systems must strengthen integration with the work organisation, improve recognition for the achievement of objectives, develop training paths also in view of the professional needs of the coming years, and provide the necessary tools to our employees in order to work safely and in compliance with the rules applicable to the specific activities carried out. \nThe valorisation of human resources is an essential element for the overall quantitative and qualitative growth of the services provided. In order to complete this valorisation process, Agile places training policies at the heart of the personnel growth process and defines a plan for employee training. \nThe training plan is intended to be a simple planning tool focused on training projects.\nIn order to ensure a greater effectiveness of the actions foreseen, the proposals developed will have as main element the growth of personnel’s skills.\nTraining in this context plays a central role in the maintenance of existing skills, the development of new professional figures and the requalification of existing ones.\nPurposes\nThe training programme therefore aims to:\n• prepare the personnel to adequately fill their positions and roles, to promote awareness among all employees of their role in a developing company;\n• integrate and update knowledge on cyber security, business continuity and personal data security in view of GDPR;\nPersonnel training planning takes into account the evolution of the topics of employee training.\nTraining will be organised and managed by the DPO with the assistance of Internal Compliance and Internal Technical Compliance. \nIt is also Agile’s intention to experiment the \"online\" training. In the case of training related to programming, employees will be allocated a package of hours that they can manage themselves using a workstation that will be made available for this purpose. With this formula, forms of \"self-training\" can be experimented.\nMethods of delivering the training activity\nTraining services can be delivered in a variety of ways:\nDistance learning;\nSelf-training;\nTraining 1v1 with the DPO; and\nCorporate LMS\nEvaluation\nThe evaluation of training is made annually by Complaince Team and reported in writing."

    "section": "GDPR Procedures and Policies",
    "level": "2.5.5.3",
    "text": "Data Breach Policy\nThis document outlines the regulations of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regarding personal data breaches (referred to as \"Data breach\") and Agile's procedure for such events.\nThe procedure is applicable and binding for all employees, consultants, collaborators of Agile, as well as for suppliers of specific services.\nFor further information on monitoring and response to potential events that jeopardize information security, please refer to the\nIncident Security Policy\n.\nIf you can't find the form of internal data breach notice on the Compliance Sharepoint, plase contact the soonest the Compliance team (\ncompliance@agilelab.it\n).\nGDPR and Data Breach\nArticles 33 and 34 of the GDPR require the data controller, in the event of a \"personal data breach,\" to:\nNotify the supervisory authority (Article 33).\nCommunicate the breach to the data subjects (Article 34).\nThe term \"personal data breach\" is defined in Article 4, Point 12, as a \"breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.\"\nTherefore, a breach occurs when:\nData no longer exists or is no longer in a form that is of any use to the data controller.\nData has been modified or altered.\nThe data controller no longer has access to or control over the data.\nData has been disclosed to unauthorized recipients.\nConsequently, a breach may involve:\nConfidentiality: In the case of data disclosure or unauthorized access.\nIntegrity: In the case of unauthorized data modification.\nAvailability: In the case of data loss or unauthorized access/destruction.\nRegarding the latter type of breaches, it is important to note that even a temporary loss of data availability constitutes a data breach scenario.\nRisk to the rights and freedoms of individuals\nThe occurrence of a data breach does not necessarily trigger the obligation to notify. It is necessary for the breach to potentially impact the exercise of rights and freedoms of the data subjects.\nNotification to the supervisory authority or data subjects is not required \"if it is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals\" or \"if it is unlikely to pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.\"\nThe data controller must objectively assess the risk, taking into account the following criteria:\nPotential harm that the breach may cause (e.g., damage to reputation, identity theft, economic loss).\nCurrency of the data.\nTypes of data involved. Certain types of data receive greater protection under the GDPR, such as judicial data, health data, and financial data.\nVolume of data involved (the number of data subjects affected by the breach).\nType of breach (e.g., unauthorized access, theft, data destruction, loss).\nAbility to identify the data subjects affected by the breach.\nSpecial characteristics of the data subjects. Certain individuals, such as vulnerable individuals (e.g., minors, disabled persons, elderly, mentally ill, asylum seekers), receive special protection within the GDPR.\nEven if the data controller believes that the conditions for notification are not met, according to Article 33(5), they are still required to document all breaches. To do so, the data controller must maintain an updated inventory of breaches that clearly shows:\nWhen the breaches occurred.\nThe resulting consequences.\nMeasures taken to address the breaches, demonstrating responsible handling in accordance with Article 32 regarding security measures.\nOther exemption grounds for notifying data subjects\nArticle 34 provides additional circumstances under which communication to data subjects is not required. These include cases where:\n\"The data controller has implemented appropriate technical and organizational protection measures, such as encryption or pseudonymization, rendering the data unintelligible to any unauthorized persons.\"\n\"Subsequent measures have been taken by the data controller to ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals is no longer likely to materialize.\"\n\"Notifying the data subjects would involve a disproportionate effort, such as in cases where the data has been lost or has not been disclosed.\"\nNotification to the Supervisory Authority\nThe data controller must notify the supervisory authority of the breach \"without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it\" (Article 33).\nFirst, it is necessary to determine the moment when the data controller becomes aware of the breach. The notification period begins from that moment.\nThe Article 29 Working Party Guidelines emphasize that \"the data controller should be regarded as aware from the time when it is reasonably certain that a security incident has occurred that has led to the compromise of personal data.\" In some cases, the breach may be clear, while in others, time may be needed to ascertain it.\nThe document also emphasizes the prompt response of the data controller and the need to adopt measures that promptly detect possible breaches. Therefore, if the data controller claims ignorance of the breach as an excuse for non-notification, it must have implemented appropriate technical measures (e.g., data flow monitoring, log analyzers) and organizational measures to promptly become aware of the breach.\nIf the data controller receives information about the breach from other parties, they have the opportunity to conduct investigations to determine whether the breach should be notified or if remedial action can be taken to avoid harm to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. However, the notification period always begins from the moment of communication.\nNotification deadline\nThe standard deadline for notification is 72 hours from the data controller's awareness of the breach. However, Article 33 allows the data controller to notify beyond the 72-hour deadline, but they must provide a justified explanation for the delay along with the notification.\nContent of the notification\nThe notification should include the following information:\nDescription of the nature of the personal data breach, including, if possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects involved, as well as the categories and approximate number of personal data records affected.\nName and contact details of the data protection officer or another contact point for obtaining further information.\nDescription of the likely consequences of the personal data breach.\nDescription of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the data controller to address the personal data breach and, if applicable, mitigate its potential negative effects.\nConsidering the primary purpose of the regulation, which is to limit the negative effects of a breach, if the data controller does not have all the necessary information, they may make a phased notification. In the initial communication to the supervisory authority, they can provide the information they have at that time and subsequently supplement it with additional information in a subsequent notification, even if it is beyond the deadline, provided that the reasons for the delay are also communicated.\nIn this case, the data protection authority will collaborate with the data controller to establish the methods and timing for providing supplementary information.\nCommunication to Data Subjects\nIn addition to notifying the supervisory authority, the data controller is also required to communicate the breach to individuals whose rights and freedoms may have been affected, in order to provide them with guidance on measures they can take to protect themselves.\nContent of the communication\nThe communication must be made \"without undue delay\" and must include:\nA description of the nature of the breach.\nName and contact details of the data protection officer or another contact point.\nA description of the likely consequences of the breach.\nA description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the data controller to address the breach and, if applicable, mitigate its potential negative effects.\nThe primary function of this communication is to provide support to data subjects in order to prevent or minimize the potential harm they may suffer, relying on the guidance provided by the supervisory authority to the data controller.\nThe direct communication to data subjects should be made through a separate message that does not contain additional information.\nOnly in cases where communication would require disproportionate effort can the data controller resort to public communication, such as posting a notice on their website.\nRelationship between the Data Controller and Data Processor\nEach data processor plays a fundamental role in enabling the data controller to comply with the provisions of the GDPR. The data processor must promptly inform the data controller in the event of a breach of the data they hold, allowing the data controller to fulfill their obligations within the specified timeframe.\nSanctions for Non-Compliance\nFailure to notify the supervisory authority or communicate the breach to data subjects may result in two types of measures:\nCorrective measures under Article 58(2) (e.g., imposing a temporary or definitive limitation on data processing, ordering communication to data subjects).\nAdministrative fines of up to 10 million euros or up to 2% of the global annual turnover.\nAdministrative fines can be imposed together with the measures under Article 58(2) or independently.\nSanctions for Non-Compliance\nData breaches are promptly recorded on the GDPR Registers by Compliance Team."

    "text": "System Administrators\nThis document describes how Agile manages the administration of the systems, in compliance with the Provision of the Guarantor for the protection of personal data of 27-11-2008, published in the Official Gazette no. 300 of 24-12-2008.\nThe list of company System Administrators is checked and updated by the Compliance Team on the relevant GDPR Register, when needed or at least on annual basis.\nCircle leaders are responsible to assess the opportunity to appoint a S.A. under a specific activity.\nPURPOSE\nTo better understand the purpose of this procedure, we report here an abstract of the preliminary considerations of the Guarantor for the protection of personal data that gives a perfect definition of \"system administrator\".\n<< With the definition of \"system administrator\" are generally identified, in the computer field, professional figures aimed at the management and maintenance of a processing plant or its components. For the purposes of this provision, however, are also considered such other comparable figures from the point of view of the risks related to data protection, such as database administrators, administrators of networks and security equipment and administrators of complex software systems.\nThe system administrators so widely identified, although not ordinarily in charge of operations that involve an understanding of the application domain (meaning of data, format of representations and semantics of functions), in their usual activities are, in many cases, concretely \"responsible\" for specific work phases that may involve high criticality in relation to data protection.\nTechnical activities such as data recovery, network flow organization, storage media management and hardware maintenance, in many cases, imply an effective ability to act on information that should be considered to all effects as a personal data treatment; this, even when the administrator does not consult the information \"in plain text\".\n... omissis ...\nthe typical functions of the administration of a system are mentioned in the said Attachment B of the D.Lgs. 196/2003 \"Code for the treatment of personal data\", in the part in which it provides the obligation for the owners to ensure the custody of the confidential components of the authentication credentials. Most of the tasks provided for in the same Attachment B typically fall to the system administrator: from the creation of security copies (data backup and recovery operations) to the custody of credentials and the management of authentication and authorization systems. >>\n1.1 Applicability\nThis document is intended for system administrators, also after appointment as external data processor under the GDPR.\n1.2 Purpose\nThe purpose of this procedure is to identify the organizational measures that will facilitate an easier knowledge, in the Company, of the existence of certain technical roles, of the responsibilities connected to such tasks and, in some cases, of the identity of the individuals who operate as system administrators in relation to the various services and databases.\nThis is in order to pay attention to the risks and critical issues involved in the appointment of system administrators, given the particular capacity of action of system administrators and the fiduciary nature of their duties.\n2. RELEVANT LEGISLATION\nIn the Official Gazette no. 300 of December 24, 2008 was published the provision issued of the Guarantor for the Protection of Personal Data on November 27, 2008 concerning:\n\"Measures and expedients prescribed for Controllers of processing carried out using electronic instruments with regard to the attributions of system administrator functions - November 27, 2008\".\nWith this measure the Guarantor for the protection of personal data,\nPursuant to art. 154, paragraph 1, lett. h) of the Code, in signaling to all holders of personal data processing, carried out with electronic instruments, the particular criticality of the role of system administrators, draws the attention of the same holders on the need to evaluate with particular attention the assignment of technical functions properly corresponding or similar to those of system administrator, database administrator or network administrator, where such functions are exercised in a context that technically make it possible for them, even accidentally, to access personal data. This, taking into consideration the opportunity or otherwise of such attribution and the concrete modalities on the basis of which the assignment is carried out, together with the technical, professional and conduct qualities of the person identified;\npursuant to art. 154, paragraph 1, lett. c) of the Code, prescribes the adoption of the following measures for owners of personal data processing subject to the application of the Code and carried out with electronic instruments, including in the judicial and police forces (art. 46 and 53 of the Code), except for those carried out in the public and private sectors for administrative-accounting purposes that pose fewer risks for those concerned and have been the subject of simplification measures introduced by law (art. 29 d.l. June 25, 2008, no. 112, conv, with amendments, with Law no. 133 of August 6, 2008; art. 34 of the Code; Garante Order of November 6, 2008):\na. Assessment of subjective characteristics\nThe attribution of the functions of system administrator must take place after evaluation of the characteristics of experience, capacity and reliability of the designated person, who must provide appropriate guarantees of full compliance with current provisions on treatment, including the security profile.\nEven when the functions of system administrator or similar are attributed only within the framework of a designation as a processor pursuant to art. 30 of the Code, the owner and the manager must, however, follow evaluation criteria equivalent to those required for the designation of managers pursuant to art. 29.\nb. Individual designations\nThe designation as system administrator must be individual and bear the analytical list of the areas of operation allowed according to the authorization profile assigned.\nc. List of System Administrators\nThe identification data of natural persons who are system administrators, with the list of functions assigned to them, must be reported in the security policy document or, in cases where the owner is not required to draw it up, noted in any case in an internal document to be kept up to date and available in case of investigation by the Guarantor.\nIf the activity of system administrators also indirectly concerns services or systems that process or allow the processing of personal information of workers, public and private owners are required to make known or make know the identity of system administrators within their organizations, according to the characteristics of the company or service, in relation to the various computer services to which they are assigned. This, using the information provided to interested parties pursuant to art. 13 of the Code as part of the working relationship that binds them to the owner, or through the technical specifications in the provision of the Guarantor n. 13 of March 1, 2007 (in G.U. March 10, 2007, n. 58) or, alternatively, through other means of internal communication (eg, corporate intranet, service orders to internal circulation or bulletins). This is without prejudice to cases in which such forms of publicity or awareness are incompatible with other legal provisions governing a specific sector.\nd. Outsourcing services\nIn the case of outsourced system administration services, the Controller must directly and specifically retain, for any eventuality, the identification details of the natural persons responsible as system administrators.\ne. Verification of activities\nThe work of system administrators must be the subject, at least once a year, of a verification activity by the Controllers, in order to check its compliance with the organizational, technical and security measures concerning the processing of personal data provided for by the regulations in force.\nf. Access registration\nAppropriate systems must be adopted to record logical access (computer authentication) to processing systems and electronic archives by system administrators. The access logs must be complete, unalterable and their integrity must be verifiable in order to achieve the purpose for which they are required. Access log must include time references and a description of the event that generated them and must be retained for an appropriate period of time, no less than six months;\nprovides that the measures and precautions referred to in point 2 of this provision are to be introduced, for all processing operations that have already commenced or will commence within thirty days of the date of publication of this provision in the Official Gazette, as soon as possible and in any case within, and no later than, the period of time that it is reasonable to establish as one hundred and twenty days from the same date; for all other processing operations that will commence after the aforementioned period of thirty days from publication, the measures and precautions must be introduced prior to the commencement of data processing.\n3. MEASURES ADOPTED BY AGILE\nThe application of the regulations to Agile's current structure leads to a distinction between two different types of systems:\nA) Agile's corporate systems and used by Agile for its own business and corporate purposes;\nB) Customer business systems managed and/or used by Agile;\n3.1 Systems Administrator sub A)\nAgile has appointed Paolo Platter and Alberto Firpo as System Administrators for its systems.\nIt has also been decided that all Systems in category A) shall always be the primary responsibility of the Company Directors, and/or of one or more individuals who shall be identified on the basis of their competencies, fiduciary relationship, the role covered in the company organizational chart and against specific written acts of delegation that shall cover the provisions of point 3.2 below.\n3.2 Systems Administrator sub B)\nWhen Agile takes on an assignment from a customer, the assumption of the position of System Administrator must be assessed in accordance with the Compliance Check Procedure [link], and involves the following actions:\nas indicated by the Compliance Check Procedure, for each individual new client must be indicated in the appropriate field of the \"contract form\" [link]:\nthe recurrence of the conditions to be considered System Administrators within the scope of the service provided, to be carried out with the intervention of the Internal Technical Compliance and/or with the assistance of the DPO;\nwhere applicable, the staff members involved (who must also be chosen on the basis of an assessment of their actual ability to hold the position of AdS as provided for in art. 4 below)\nany additional technical elements or notes regarding the above issues.\nwithin 5 days from the drafting of the \"contract form\" and in any case no later than the start of the activities, the Internal Compliance Department sends to the staff members identified as AdS the appointment document below (ANNEX A), together with the \"vademecum\" (ANNEX B);\nwithin the following 3 days, the Internal Compliance Department must verify receipt and request any non-fulfillment;\nin the event of refusal or non-receipt of the appointment letter duly countersigned by the staff concerned, the Internal Compliance Department shall inform the Company's Directors for the necessary measures (including the replacement of the persons allocated to the particular activity).\n3.3 Maintenance and updating of the \"AdS Register\".\nThe Company has kept a specific register of appointments to the AdS, saved on the Sharepoint Compliance (the \"AdS Register\"), together with further detailed information on the System of reference.\nAt the time of the appointment of each new AdS as provided above, the Internal Compliance Department will ensure the timely updating of the AdS Register.\nThe Internal Compliance and the Internal Technical Compliance, on at least a six-monthly basis, will jointly verify the regular maintenance and updating of the AdS Register.\nThe work of the System Administrator is subject, at least once every six months, to verification by Internal Technical Compliance, by means of questionnaires, in order to check its compliance with the organizational, technical and security measures regarding the processing of personal data provided for by the regulations in force, verifying the effective application of the provisions of art. 4 below.\n4.  CONTROLS\nWith regard to the measures and precautions prescribed for the holders of treatments carried out with electronic instruments in relation to the attribution of the functions of system administrator, pursuant to the provision of the Guarantor for the protection of personal data of November 27, 2008, the following actions were put in place:\na. Assessment of subjective characteristics\nThe attribution of the functions of System Administrator must take place after evaluation of the characteristics of experience, capacity and reliability of the designated person, who provides sufficient guarantee of full compliance with current provisions on treatment, including the security profile.\nb. Individual designations\nThe appointment as System Administrator is individual and contains an analytical list of the areas of operations allowed on the basis of the authorization profile assigned, as described in the first part of this paragraph.\nc. Outsourced Services\nIn the case of outsourced system administration services, the owner directly and specifically keeps, for any eventuality, the identification details of the natural persons appointed as System Administrators.\nd. Access Registration\nSuitable systems have been adopted for recording access to processing systems and electronic archives by System Administrators for Systems Sub A).\nFor Systems Sub B), methods for recording access to processing systems and electronic archives are provided by customers."

    "section": "GDPR Procedures and Policies",
    "level": "2.5.5.9",
    "text": "Privacy by Design and by Default Policy\nIntroduction and Scope\nThis policy is applicable to all Agile personnel. According to Article 23 of the GDPR, Agile is obligated to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures (taking into account the costs and nature of the processing, the risks for individuals, etc.), such as pseudonymization, to ensure compliance with the principles outlined in the GDPR and adequate protection of the rights of data subjects. These measures may vary depending on the type of processing activities carried out, and it is essential that they are clear not only at the beginning but throughout the entire duration of the processing by Agile personnel during the life cycle of the system/software. This obligation will be referred to as \"Privacy by Design\".\nAmong the minimum requirements, there should be a prohibition on making personal data available to an indefinite number of individuals without their involvement (hereinafter referred to as \"Privacy by Default\").\nThis policy aims to provide guidance on the approach Agile should take to ensure compliance with Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default.\nFor any questions, please contact Agile's Compliance Team at the following email:\ncompliance@agilelab.it\n.\nInterpretation\nDefinitions of terms used in this policy:\nData Subject: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.\nSpecial Categories of Personal Data: These are the so-called \"sensitive\" data, which reveal racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, political opinions, trade union membership, health data, or data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation. The GDPR (Article 9) also includes genetic data, biometric data, and data concerning criminal convictions and offenses in this category.\nData Relating to Criminal Convictions and Offenses: These are the so-called \"judicial\" data, which can reveal the existence of certain judicial measures subject to inclusion in criminal records (such as final criminal convictions, probation, prohibition or obligation to reside, alternative measures to detention) or the status of suspect or accused. The GDPR (Article 10) includes data relating to criminal convictions and offenses or related security measures within this notion.\nData Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA): Assessment of the impact of personal data processing on specific operations and/or systems, as regulated by Article 35.\nPrinciples of Processing: Refers to Article 5 of the GDPR, which governs the principles of processing.\nThe Compliance Team will annually verify the possibility of integrating this Policy in light of any regulatory changes or improvements in technical measures.\nPrivacy by Design - General Principles\nThe principles of Privacy by Design are as follows:\nProactive use instead of reactive use of adoptable measures. The aim should be to anticipate, identify, and prevent privacy-related incidents before they occur.\nPrivacy protection rules must always be present and considered as defaults within business activities. Personal data must be automatically protected in any company system, without requiring any action from the individual to protect their privacy.\nPrivacy must be integrated and embedded in the design of systems and business practices.\nSecurity should be end-to-end throughout the entire lifecycle of personal data. Personal data should be kept secure and destroyed when no longer necessary.\nVisibility and transparency should be maintained. Stakeholders should always be assured that business practices and technologies are effectively operating according to predetermined objectives and subject to periodic checks.\nRespect for user privacy through the adoption of predefined protection standards and user-friendly options during the software development phase.\nTechnical and Organizational Measures\nAgile's objective is to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to:\nAppropriately implement the Principles of Personal Data Protection.\nIntegrate the necessary precautions within the processing of personal data to achieve the aforementioned objective.\nDuring their activities, Agile personnel will consider the available technical and organizational measures, the cost of implementation, the nature of the measures, the purpose, context, and objectives of the processing, as well as the risks and severity to which the rights and freedoms of individuals are exposed during processing.\nIn cases where the processing is considered to pose a high risk to individuals, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must be conducted in accordance with Agile's procedures.\nPrivacy by Default\nAgile aims to apply technical and organizational measures to ensure that, by default, only the necessary personal data is used in relation to the following activities:\nCalculating the number of personal data collected.\nAssessing the extent of personal data processing.\nDetermining the retention period of personal data.\nAssessing the accessibility of personal data.\nData Protection by Design\nAgile's objective is to always consider the impact that processing may have on individuals and to adopt proportionate technical and organizational measures to ensure that:\nThe Principles of Processing are effectively implemented.\nRisks to the rights and freedoms of individuals are effectively minimized.\nAgile personnel should continuously exercise controls to ensure the security of systems and personal data and to avoid the risk of possible data breaches resulting from unauthorized remote logins.\nPersonal data should only be uploaded to systems, devices, and/or software that comply with Agile's policies and applicable laws. The use and retention period of data should be minimized.\nRegular checks and improvements, where possible, should be conducted by Agile personnel.\nPersonnel should not proceed with the purchase or deployment of new systems or software without first evaluating their impact on personal data protection, especially if such acquisition and subsequent use may pose a risk to individuals.\nFor the procurement of supplies and services, regardless of the contract value, personnel cannot approve the contract without first conducting a review with the assistance of the Compliance Team to assess the level of personal data protection.\nExamples of Risk Mitigation Techniques\nExamples of techniques that can be implemented to comply with the objectives of this procedure include, but are not limited to: employee awareness through training provided by the DPO, making personnel aware of possible scams such as emails from fake accounts, regular deletion of materials containing personal data, irreversible anonymization of data, transparency towards data subjects through privacy policies, and limitation of access to personnel where possible."

    "text": "Backup Policy\nPurpose\nThis document aims to define the methods and responsibilities for the proper management of database backups and archives containing personal data, as well as the management and storage of removable media and data restoration in the event of data loss or integrity issues.\nEquipment failures, accidental errors, and deliberate attacks can result in the loss of important data. Therefore, measures need to be activated to ensure the availability and continuity of services by creating backup copies that allow for the recovery of damaged information.\nBackup Criteria\nBackups are stored remotely.\nBackups are encrypted at rest and in transit.\nBackups are only accessible to internal IT members.\nBackups are retained for at least 1 year.\nRestoration procedures are tested at least every 6 months.\nAn inventory of backups is kept up to date.\nIf the backup process causes unavailability of the respective service, it will be conducted during non-working hours.\nBackup and Restoration Procedure\nFor each service, the internal IT team assesses the need for backups. Services that may be excluded from backups are:\nServices used for testing purposes.\nNon-critical services for the company.\nServices that provide high availability and fault recovery strategies.\nFor all other services, a customized procedure is defined by the internal IT team based on acceptable risk and data importance.\nIn detail:\nBackup procedure\nRestoration procedure\nBackup scheduling\nBackup frequency\nAll backups are stored in a dedicated AWS S3 bucket.\nFor all services that undergo backups, whether manual or automatic, the following must be specified:\nBackup execution date\nAuthor\nStorage location\nThe following document provides the status of backups for each company service.\nServices Management\nData Restoration Procedures\nIn the event of data loss or damage to critical services, partial or complete data restoration is possible. The restoration is performed by the Data Controller or by an authorized individual appointed by the Data Controller.\nThe restoration procedure depends on the specific service and is defined by the internal IT team, as mentioned earlier.\nTraining and Information for Personnel\nIn line with the principle of accountability, this procedure will be widely disseminated through:\nSharing on the company's public space (SharePoint).\nPresentation in training courses designed within the company on the subject matter.\nAdoption and Review of the Procedure\nThis procedure is effective immediately and will be constantly updated in light of organizational, technical, and regulatory changes that occur in the field."

    "text": "Security Events\nFor the purpose of information security in Agile Lab's systems, the Company adopts the following policy and stipulates that the dedicated CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team), appointed due to, and in accordance with, NIS2 Directive, which also performs the functions of Business Continuity Officer in accordance with ISO 22301, constitutes the \"Incident Response Team\" functional to this policy. It is composed of representatives from the main technical and operational areas of the Company.\nThis procedure pertains to any event that is potentially capable of causing a breach, loss, and/or alteration of information stored in Agile Lab's computer systems and/or managed by Agile Lab on behalf of its clients, including but not limited to:\nMalware and DDoS attacks\nUnauthorized access\nInternal violations\nUnauthorized privilege escalation\nTheft or loss of devices\nIf the incident is potentially capable of constituting a \"data breach\" as defined in Article 35 of the GDPR, the Incident Response Team will inform the Legal Representative of the Company, the Lead link of the Legal and Internal Compliance Circle and the DPO to initiate the corresponding procedure.\nAssessment and Decision\nWithin 24 hours of the event, the Incident Response Team will provide the Compliance Team with a report on the relevant incident and the possible technical actions.\nThe incident closure report is an internal document that provides a summary of the following information:\nDate and time of incident closure report communication\nDetected events that led to the opening of the incident record\nDate and time of incident management record opening\nList of investigations conducted to detect and circumscribe the perimeter within which the security breach of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) was identified\nList of damages suffered\nReferences to evidence substantiating the identification of the damages, without attaching the evidence itself\nDetailed list of ICT assets that have suffered damages (systems, devices, technology chains, applications, etc.)\nSummary of observed SLAs (Service Level Agreements) during the incident management process and possible justification for any delays caused\nOnce the ICT assets affected by the event and the associated attack category have been identified, ICT security operators assess the impact of the violation on the ICT assets and/or the information assets of Agile Lab. They use the following evaluative scale:\nSevere\n: Indicates a violation of ICT security policies that results in permanent and irreversible damage to ICT assets and/or Agile Lab's information assets\nRelevant\n: Indicates activities associated with the detection of ICT security violations that result in temporary and reversible damage to ICT assets and/or Agile Lab's information assets\nSignificant\n: Indicates activities associated with the detection of attempted ICT security violations that do not pose a direct threat to ICT assets and/or Agile Lab's information assets. This category includes anomalous user behaviors and applications that do not require specific containment measures, except for monitoring to prevent or contain any subsequent attacks\nFalse positive\n: Indicates theoretically malicious events that do not result in any ICT security violation in the specific context under examination. If events are identified as false positives, the alarm classification process is terminated, and the possibility of filtering such events from the tracking systems should be considered to avoid overburdening incident management activities with repetitive operations. Otherwise, the alarm is classified, and all subsequent activities related to alarm or incident management are carried out\nThe Compliance Team is responsible for determining whether an incident has occurred and indicating the remedial actions to be taken.\nThe criticality assessment of the ICT asset, expressed on a three-value scale (High, Medium, Low), includes analytical activities aimed at evaluating the criticality of the context in which security violation events have been detected. The criticality value of the asset can be derived from the classification of the provided service, determined through appropriate Risk Assessment activities performed on ICT assets, or based on evaluations of the information processed by the systems.\nDetection and Reporting\nIn the event of a potential incident, the Compliance Team of the Company must be immediately notified, no later than 5 hours, at\ncompliance@agilelab.it\n, which will verify the activation of this procedure.\nThe above will be recorded in the Data Breach Register maintained by the Company.\nResponses\nThe Incident Response Team will monitor the execution of incident remediation actions, if necessary, and provide written updates to the Compliance Team on a periodic basis.\nLessons Learned\nWithin 30 days of the incident, the Compliance Team will assess possible improvements and implementations to internal procedures to prevent the recurrence of the same incident.\nNIS2 Incident Management and Notification Obligations\nAny event that may significantly affect the availability, integrity or confidentiality of network and information systems used by Agile Lab for the provision of services must be treated as a NIS2 Security Incident, even if no personal data is involved\nIn the event of a potentially NIS2-relevant incident, the Internal Computer Security Incident Response Team (Internal CSIRT) must activate the NIS2 notification workflow and immediately inform the Compliance Team\nWhere required under NIS2, Agile Lab shall ensure notification to the competent authority/CSIRT Italia as follows:\nEarly Warning within 24 hours of becoming aware of the incident\nIncident Notification within 72 hours, including the initial impact assessment and mitigation actions\nFinal Report within one month\nWhen Agile Lab acts as a supplier or Processor, it shall notify the client without undue delay to enable the client to fulfil its own NIS2 regulatory obligations\nCommunication Flows to the Parent Company\nAll incidents classified as Severe, Relevant, all GDPR personal data breaches, and all events that may constitute significant NIS2 incidents must be reported without delay to the Parent Company through the designated communication channels\nThe Internal CSIRT shall provide periodic updates to the Parent Company until the incident is fully resolved and shall supply any documents, technical assessments or audit-related information requested\nThe Parent Company may request additional verification activities, forensic analysis or corrective measures as part of its supervisory role\nInternal Notification Timeframes (NIS2 + Governance)\nAny potential security incident must be reported to the Compliance Team immediately and in any case no later than 5 hours\nSuch internal notification activates both the general Incident Management Procedure and, when applicable, the NIS2 notification workflow\nIncident Recording\nAll NIS2-relevant security events must be logged in the Security Incident Register, alongside GDPR data breaches recorded in the Data Breach Register\nThe entry must include the rationale for NIS2 classification, expected impact and containment actions taken\nIntegration to the \"Lessons Learned\" Section - NIS2 and Group Oversight\nWithin 30 days of incident closure, the Compliance Team shall assess the adequacy of the NIS2 controls applied and identify preventive or corrective actions\nWhere required, the Lessons Learned Report shall be communicated to the Parent Company for alignment and supervisory purposes"

    "section": "Integrated Management System",
    "level": "2.5.6.3",
    "text": "Access Management\nPurpose\nThis instruction aims to define the criteria to be followed for the management and use of an information authentication and authorization system. It applies to all individuals involved in the processing of personal data who utilize electronic tools.\nA variety of services are used in daily routines, for purposes such as development, management, marketing, etc.\nThe management of these services falls under the responsibility of the Internal IT department, which has centralized access control and cost monitoring.\nWithin the Internal IT department, the role and focus define the services for which the associated person is an administrator. For operational load balancing reasons, a service can be administered by multiple individuals.\nAccess Control\nAccess to the electronic tools used for data processing is only allowed through the use of authentication credentials.\nService administrators are responsible for authorizing the creation, modification, and deletion of new users and their authentication credentials on the applications.\nUpon formalizing authorization for the processing of personal data, each individual is assigned authentication credentials, consisting of a personal identification code (ID) and a temporary reserved password.\nThose involved in data processing are responsible for managing their passwords, changing the temporary one assigned to them at the first login, and updating them periodically (every 6 months for processing exclusively personal data and every 3 months for processing sensitive data).\nAuthorized individuals must ensure the confidentiality of the reserved component of the credential and diligently safeguard the devices in their possession for exclusive use.\nA single identification code (login) cannot be used by different individuals.\nWhen a new service is adopted, users are added following the principle of least privilege, granting them sufficient access to perform the required work.\nAs with all requests within the department, onboarding activities are initiated via email to internalit@agilelab.it, containing details of the tasks to be performed.\nSimilarly, all additions, modifications, and deletions are supervised by the respective service administrator.\nSSO (Single Sign-On)\nWhenever possible, SSO should be adopted through Azure AD integration. This allows precise access control for specific user groups.\nFurthermore, user access is automatically revoked during offboarding.\nIn this case as well, enabling new users, which involves assigning them to the appropriate LDAP group, is the responsibility of the relevant role within the Internal IT department.\nSimple Accounts\nEach individual has their own authorization profile and can only access the data they are allowed to or, for the sake of administrative management simplicity, the data allowed for the homogeneous class of the role they belong to.\nThese authorization profiles are configured in the appropriate security and authorization control tools used on the platforms.\nAuthorization profiles for each individual or homogeneous classes of individuals are identified and configured before the start of processing, limiting access to only the data necessary to perform the processing operations.\nHowever, it is possible that some services may not offer this functionality. In such cases, internal IT members will record and manage access assignments.\nAll accounts must comply with the company's security standards (password security, MFA, inactivity lock).\nIn this situation as well, the creation of accounts and the granting of authorizations are requested from the role within the Internal IT department.\nIn this scenario, account removal must be performed manually as part of the offboarding procedure.\nThese statements must be considered when evaluating new services. During the setup and configuration of the service, the Internal IT representative will apply the most appropriate security features offered by the service. Services that do not provide an adequate level of security cannot be adopted.\nAt least annually, the authorization profiles of individual assignees are verified. In the event of changes to the authorization profile or new processing activities, a new appointment letter and authorization profile are provided.\nRoot Accounts\nRoot accounts should not be limited to a single person for restoration purposes when needed; therefore, they should be used strictly for administrative activities.\nRoot accounts are always managed by the Internal IT department.\nShared Accounts:\nShared accounts that are not root accounts are discouraged. Exceptions must be carefully evaluated by the Internal IT department, and if approved, the reasons and individuals with access must be clearly defined. This information must be recorded and maintained in the \"Shared Account Module.\"\nAudit\nEvery 6 months, the Internal IT department will review all user and administrative accounts, and discrepancies and corrective actions will be recorded.\nAuthentication credentials that have not been used for at least 6 months are deactivated, except those previously authorized for technical management purposes.\nCredentials are also deactivated in case of loss of the quality that allows the individual access to personal data, such as in the following cases:\nTermination of employment (resignation or dismissal)\nChange of position\nPhysical account deletion is performed periodically by the information systems, usually once a year, after archiving the company's data owned by the account.\nPersonnel Training and Information\nIn accordance with the principle of accountability, this procedure will be widely disseminated through:\nPublication on the company's intranet\nPresentation in company-designed training courses on the subject\nAdoption and Revision of the Procedure:\nThis procedure takes immediate effect and will be constantly updated in light of organizational, technical, and regulatory changes in the field.\nAccess Control for Clients and Potential Clients\nIn the absence of an AGILE LAB S.r.l. employee, the workstation should be:\nIn order (without any unattended documentation)\nWith the desktop PC turned off or locked\nClients\nClients are only admitted to the room when an AGILE LAB S.r.l. operator is available.\nClients are identified by the AGILE LAB S.r.l. staff member who carries out the requested operations.\nThe AGILE LAB S.r.l. staff member manages and monitors the client throughout their stay in the room.\nFurthermore:\nThe operations requested by the client are recorded in the application.\nClients are not admitted to the room outside of working hours.\nConsiderations\nOnce past the entrance door, guests cannot move freely within the premises.\nThe access control system records the movements of various guests.\nRegarding access outside working hours, it is only available for administrators.\nGuests are defined as:\nGuest personnel (collaborators and personnel from external companies) with continuous presence authorized to move independently (more than 2 weekly accesses)\nCollaborators with occasional presence\nVisitors\nAuthorized guest personnel who are allowed to move independently are not subject to the procedure described on the following page and must sign designations and commitments that bind them to specific rules of conduct and confidentiality."

    "section": "Integrated Management System",
    "level": "2.5.6.4",
    "text": "Tools for Document Management\nAgileLab primarily uses three tools for document management:\nHandbook\nThe AgileLab handbook is the central repository for managing how the company operates, ensuring efficient and easy communication and information flow. It provides access to information about processes and guidelines for all branches and remote workers.\nThe handbook is designed to make all company information accessible to everyone, regardless of when they joined the team.\nResponsibility: The handbook and its updates are managed by Internal IT and/or other authorized functions.\nSharePoint\nSharePoint is used to enhance teamwork for project teams, departments, and divisions. It allows for the sharing of files, data, news, and resources.\nResponsibility: The \"Compliance\" SharePoint site is managed by the Compliance team.\nAll staff can collaborate easily and securely within and outside the organization, using PCs, Macs, and mobile devices.\nAgilecompliance.website\nAgileLab uses this public repository for compliance, which serves as a supplement to other tools and contains key documents for both the public and staff.\nResponsibility: Agilecompliance.website is managed and updated by the Compliance team as needed or at least every six months.\nInformation Classification\nAll information resources are classified into one of the following three categories. The information must be appropriately labeled to ensure easy identification of its classification.\nClassification:\nRestricted: Information whose unauthorized disclosure (even within the organization) could cause significant harm in terms of financial losses, legal actions, or reputation damage.\nAccess is limited to personnel with specific roles, permissions, or access rights mandated by law, such as:\nDisciplinary records.\nAudit reports.\nPersonal health and safety consultations and reports.\nPayroll and personnel management documents.\nControlled: Information generally available to anyone within AgileLab's areas and containing business value for the organization or requiring protection due to personal data.\nAccess is limited to internal staff based on their job responsibilities, including:\nBusiness continuity plans.\nIT procedures related to networks, backups, etc.\nContracts.\nSensitive business files.\nWork plan development.\nDocumentation related to vendors.\nPublic: Information that can be made available to the public without causing harm or prejudice if disclosed.\nContact information.\nPress releases.\nPolicies and procedures.\nForms.\nMeeting minutes not exempted.\nStatistics and performance indicators.\nGeneral information on hiring and employment conditions.\nIf information is grouped, the highest classification applies to all information within the group.\nPurpose and Scope\nThis instruction defines the procedures and responsibilities for managing AgileLab's primary documentation within the management system. This includes documented information such as guidelines, instructions, forms/records, their identification, issuance, distribution, modification, storage, and disposal.\nIt also covers documentation such as laws, regulations, various external and internal technical documents.\nFor proper document management, adherence to the rules of preparation, coding, and processing as defined below is necessary:\nPreparation\nDocuments are written using simple, clear, and understandable language for the intended recipients.\nThe wording should be prescriptive and not subject to interpretation. When using concepts, abbreviations, or equipment names that are not universally known, a glossary should be provided.\nThe treatment should be straightforward and linear, leaving specific instructions or alternative steps to supporting instructions.\nForms should contain clear explanatory references for the fields to be completed. Where possible, grids with predefined options should be used rather than blank spaces. If coded information is used, a glossary should be specified in the document's notes.\nCoding and Identification\nAll documents that impact quality are uniquely coded using the following criteria:\nChapters of the management system guidelines\nThe chapters of the guidelines refer to the paragraph numbering of the relevant reference standard, such as ISO 9001:2015, with the addition of chapters from ISO 27001 and ISO 22301, following the High-Level Structure numbering.\nFor example, the chapter 4 (Organizational Context) of the guidelines, in compliance with UNI EN ISO 9001:2015, corresponds to paragraph 4 (Organizational Context) of the referenced standard.\nThe guidelines are managed with a code (LGSI) and revision index.\nQuality Guidelines, Information Security, and Business Continuity Chapters\nPurpose: Provides a brief description of the objectives pursued.\nScope: Describes when and to what extent the chapter applies.\nGeneral Information and Responsibilities: Provides a macro description of the company's activities with clear reference to management responsibilities.\nOperational Instructions\nThe body of the instruction consists of only two paragraphs:\nPurpose: Describes the purpose of the operational instruction.\nInstruction: Contains the text of the operational instruction.\nIt clarifies what needs to be done, when, and by whom.\nFor each activity, it defines the required documentation and data to be recorded.\nIn many cases, the completion of one activity is a prerequisite for starting the next. Ensure that this is clear from the description.\nIn other cases, activities are performed simultaneously, and the results of two activities may form the basis for a third.\nFormat and Support\nDocumentation is collected and stored within the public repository www.Agilecompliance.website, while classified documents are stored in SharePoint.\nThese documents, whether written or stored electronically, allow for trend analysis and the improvement of the management system's implementation and effectiveness.\nRegistration Forms\nRegistration forms, often consisting of lists or tables, are not rigidly structured and only require the general rules mentioned for their preparation.\nFiles or electronically stored documents should include identification and be coded with the file name or topic identification and/or issuance date (at least in the file indexing).\nIf documents are completed in file format, the date should be included, and if a signature is required, the compiler's name should be used instead.\nAccess to electronic documents (if applicable) is password protected.\nFiles or electronically stored documents are safeguarded through regular backup activities (at different times during the day and on dedicated media). Data related to document management, technical management, accounting, and system management are backed up by AMM. The backup media are stored in locations ensuring their physical protection.\nThe information systems do not require backups, as support contracts with software vendors cover updates and system functionality.\nTo safeguard electronic data, an antivirus solution with automatic updates is implemented.\nLifecycle Definitions\nRetention periods for documentation have been identified and summarized in the system's documentation summary module.\nResponsibilities for issuance, verification, and approval\nSystem documents are prepared by the Quality Representative in collaboration with the function responsible for their application and approved by the Management.\nThe organization has defined appropriate rules for modifications, archiving, distribution, and management of obsolete documents, as described below:\nModification\nEach function may propose modifications to documents or the data contained within. The proposed changes are reviewed and submitted for verification and approval to the same functions that performed the original document verification and approval activities.\nArchiving\nThe Quality Representative (RQ) is responsible for archiving the issued documentation and managing the archive of obsolete documents.\nRQ also manages the archiving of externally sourced documents such as standards and conformity certificates, whether in electronic or hard copy form.\nThe company also manages electronic data. By exclusively using cloud services for storage, AgileLab adheres to the methods indicated by the primary provider (Microsoft) for enterprise environments, including AWS and Google for some additional services.\nDistribution\nRQ is responsible for distributing all system documents and maintaining traceability of the distribution performed.\nSending or delivering documents to external entities is done via certified mail, and RQ is responsible for preserving the corresponding email.\nDistribution of the Handbook, which contains binding documents on privacy (Section A), information security (Section B), and system administrators (Section C), is also provided to internal and external stakeholders as needed.\nIt should be noted that AgileLab uses Microsoft Intune for device and application management. The terms and features of the service can be viewed at the following link: [insert link]\nObsolete Management\nRQ separately retains obsolete or superseded versions of documents as a historical record of changes over time.\nManagement of Standards and Laws\nRQ is responsible for collecting, cataloging, and updating standards, laws, directives issued by Italian or international standardization bodies, as well as industry-specific regulations. Additionally, legal requirements are also considered. These documents are relevant to the functioning of the implemented systems and should be available in their updated version for review.\nAll external reference documents are summarized in the dedicated Module 01-5 Document List, which is managed by RQ in collaboration with the relevant function units (RFUs).\nIt is the responsibility of RQ to keep this document up to date, conducting at least semi-annual verifications documented directly in the module.\nAny new documents must be communicated to other function managers and, if necessary, to the operators.\nRQ should update the collection of cited documents by acquiring new versions and ensuring the list remains current. Support for this activity is obtained through:\nWebsite: www.uni.com/it-it\nWebsite: www.bancaditalia.it/statistiche/raccolta-dati\nCloud service providers\nOrganizational consulting firms\nRQ resolves difficult interpretation issues with the collaboration of:\nLegal firms for legal interpretation difficulties\nQualified consulting firms for technical issues\nRelevant authorities\nIn case of revision, RQ must obtain the document by archiving the old version as obsolete and updating the document list.\nAll documentation (document list, individual standards, circulars) is archived by RQ in electronic form or, if unavailable electronically, in hard copy form.\nDocumented information is managed in accordance with applicable regulations and covers the following points:\nRisks and opportunities (6.1)\nIndicators and objectives (6.2.1)\nInformation security risk assessment process (6.1.2)\nStatement of Applicability for controls (Appendix A of the standard) (6.1.3 d)\nRisk treatment plan (6.1.3)\nObjectives for information security (6.2)\nDocumented information for personnel (7.2.2)\nDocumented information for requirement reviews (8.2.3)\nDesign requirements (8.3)\nSupplier evaluation (8.4.1)\nDocumented information necessary to provide confidence in process conformity and product reliability (8.5.d)\nResults of process validation (8.5)\nEvidence related to traceability (8.5.2)\nRecords related to customer property preservation (8.5.3)\nResults of change reviews related to production and service delivery (8.5.6)\nRecords of approval for product release (8.6)\nNonconforming products (8.7)\nBusiness continuity plan (8.8)\nPerformance and effectiveness evaluation of the management system (9.1.1)\nInternal audits (9.2)\nManagement review documented information (9.3.3)\nEvidence of product conformity (10.2.2)\nCorrective actions (10.2.2)\nThe responsibility for archiving rests with the functions responsible for the various activities under the supervision of the Quality Manager.\nThe responsibility for managing documented information is assigned to the functions responsible for their issuance.\nWhen contractually required, quality records are made available for customer evaluation by agreement. In defining storage locations, the company has considered:\nImmediate traceability\nAdequate preservation\nIt should be noted that access to documentation is granted to all function managers, with the exception of documented information related to the responsibilities of the Management, which is accessible only to the Management itself.\nThe responsibility for eliminating archived material upon expiration rests solely with the Management."

    "level": "2.5.6.5",
    "text": "Purpose\nThe purpose of this Operating Instruction is to describe the criteria and procedures for qualifying the company's suppliers, in order to create a list of qualified suppliers to draw from when it is necessary to make purchases of materials/products, consulting services, and services provided by subcontracting companies.\nOperational Procedures\nSupplier Qualification\nBased on the company's needs, market research is conducted to identify potential suppliers, either as alternatives or in addition to existing ones.\nSuppliers must undergo evaluation.\nThe following distinction is made:\nQualified Suppliers: These are all \"active\" suppliers to whom purchases of goods and services are directed; their supply has an influence on process quality and therefore needs to be evaluated. (This category does not include any suppliers imposed by the Client under contract).\nOccasional Suppliers: These are suppliers to be contacted for exceptional or emergency purchases, used for a single supply of product/service, for which no evaluation is carried out.\nThe qualification, through evaluation activities, is conducted by ACQ after consulting with RQ and, if necessary, other relevant functions.\nInitially, all suppliers are considered qualified, meaning those who have collaborated effectively in the last year prior to the issuance of the List. They are directly included in the \"Qualified Suppliers List\" with the label \"historical\" and their performance is monitored in the following year.\nNew suppliers are added to the list by ACQ after issuing the Purchase Order.\nMonitoring of Qualified Suppliers\nAt the end of the year, ACQ reviews the performance of suppliers by assigning scores to the predetermined parameters. Accordingly, the supplier is either confirmed or corrective actions are requested, with the possibility of keeping the supplier under observation for 12 months and potentially excluding them in the absence of improvements.\nThe parameters for evaluation can be used individually or in combination, depending on the type of supplier being evaluated. The supplier (except for historical ones upon inclusion) is evaluated annually for the following aspects, with scores assigned:\nPrice/performance\nEconomic capacity (in relation to the company's payment requirements)\nTechnical-organizational structure (supporting the Supplier)\nCompliance with delivery times\nRecorded non-conformities\nThe calculation is performed by taking the average of the scores assigned for each parameter.\nThe minimum qualification threshold is set at an overall average score of \"6\".\nFor criteria A) B) C) D): EVALUATION / SCORE / DESCRIPTION\nExcellent 8: Optimal for company needs\nFair 7: Regularly fulfills the required commitments with minor shortcomings\nSufficient 6: Has shortcomings and is not regular in fulfilling the required commitments\nInsufficient 5: Has deficiencies, creates unacceptable problems\nFor criterion E): EVALUATION / SCORE / DESCRIPTION\nExcellent 8: No non-conformities identified in the year\nFair 7: One non-conformity identified in the year\nSufficient 6: Up to three non-conformities identified in the year\nInsufficient 5: More than three non-conformities identified in the year\nThe status of identified non-conformities is recorded by RQ through Non-Conformity Reports issued to suppliers.\nA new supplier, upon inclusion in the list, is only evaluated using parameters A, B, C. At the end of the year, the evaluation is supplemented with the other two parameters (if applicable for the type of supply, excluding service providers).\nManagement of Subcontracting\nThe use of subcontractors, if expressly authorized by the Client, does not modify the contractual obligations and responsibilities of the Company, which remains solely responsible and the point of contact with the Client and third parties for the work performed by subcontractors.\nAny failures of subcontractors, as determined by the Client, obligate the Company to take appropriate actions in more serious cases, potentially leading to the termination of the subcontract itself and the assumption of related work directly or, if permitted by the Client, with a new subcontractor, following the necessary authorization process. The Company cannot request compensation, damages, or deadline extensions.\nIt is the responsibility of the Company that has entered into the subcontract to verify that the subcontractor provides the necessary personnel in the required numbers and qualifications to perform the work.\nSubcontracting of work is possible within the limits set by Law No. 55 of March 19, 1990 (anti-mafia law).\nManagement of Site Access\nAll suppliers who provide services at our premises or deliver materials must go to the reception for registration. They must also review the Supplier Information Sheet and register at the reception before accessing the goods unloading areas.\nAll suppliers and consultants must register at the reception before accessing operational areas. For the management process, refer to the Access Management Operating Instruction.\nReceipt of Incoming Materials\nUpon arrival of materials, the designated personnel must verify the incoming goods following the procedure outlined below:\nCheck the quantities of the delivered goods against the Transport Document (TD), noting any discrepancies on the TD and informing the responsible function to open a Non-Conformity.\nCheck the integrity of the incoming material or the integrity of the packaging. If damaged, conduct a thorough inspection and return it to the Supplier or promptly report the discrepancy to the client, as appropriate. If the material is not suitable for use and immediate return is not possible, identify it as Non-Conforming material and, if possible, store it in the designated area until it can be returned to the Supplier or receive specific communication from the client, as appropriate. Note any anomalies identified on the TD and inform the responsible function to open a Non-Conformity and make subsequent decisions and potential communication with the client.\nVerify that the received material corresponds in quantity, type, and delivery terms to the purchase order issued by the Procurement Function or any previously communicated/transmitted lists provided by the client if the material is owned by them.\nIf the received material does not match the order or any communicated/transmitted lists by the client in terms of type, or if necessary due to the lack of necessary marking, the person identifying the anomaly must immediately contact the person responsible for issuing the order or RSGI to coordinate the next steps.\nIf this is not possible, identify it as Non-Conforming material and, if possible, store it in the designated area until the anomaly is communicated to the person responsible for issuing the order or to RSGI, and until the anomaly is resolved. Open a Non-Conformity or inform the responsible function to make decisions and potential communication with the client.\nIf the material is Non-Conforming due to delays or quantities lower than the order or any communicated/transmitted lists by the client, the material will be considered conforming and will be put into production. However, a Non-Conformity must still be recorded, and the necessary steps must be followed or the responsible function must be informed to make decisions and potential communication with the client."

This involves either removing the risk (eliminating the root cause of the risk), transferring the risk (insurance, outsourcing, etc.), reducing the risk (implementing appropriate controls, etc.), or retaining the risk.\nThe ISO 27001 standard includes 134 security measures (or controls). The applicability of these 134 controls, along with the reasons for their selection or exclusion, is described in a document called the Statement of Applicability, in a section of the MR 6.1.1 Risk Assessment (VERA).\nBased on the Risk Treatment Plan in a section of the MR 6.1.1 Risk Assessment (VERA), a list of instructions and their corresponding controls has been established, grouping them according to their scope (one instruction may implement multiple controls of the same type, for example, those related to network management or personnel).\nRisk treatment is carried out through various sections of the MR 6.1.1 Risk Assessment (VERA).\nIn risk removal, the condition or activity giving rise to the examined risk must be eliminated. Risk removal may involve terminating or relocating activities that pose a deemed high risk. In risk transfer, the risk must be transferred to a party capable of managing it. Risk transfer may introduce new risks or modify existing ones. In risk retention, the decision is made to accept the risk without implementing any measures. Finally, in risk reduction, the impact of a particular risk must be reduced so that the residual risk becomes tolerable. Suitable controls must be selected, considering existing constraints such as time, budget, technical, cultural, and legal factors.\nRisk Acceptance\nThe decision is made to accept the risks because they are compatible with the adopted criteria and because the cost of risk treatment is deemed too high.\nRisk Communication\nRisks are communicated through an information channel to stakeholders both within and outside the organization. This ensures that those responsible for implementing the risk management plan understand the underlying elements on which decisions are based and which require specific actions to be taken.\nRisk Monitoring and Review\nRisks, assets, threats, and vulnerabilities must be monitored and reviewed to immediately identify significant changes, taking into account legal constraints, competitive aspects, asset values, and risk acceptance criteria.\nAppendix A: List of Typical Threats\nThe following list can be used as a starting point to create a relevant list of threats that may affect the information assets identified in the inventory."

The definition of assets is understood as \"anything that has value to the organization\" and therefore deserves protection. This includes tangible resources such as development programs, operational machinery, as well as information resources such as customer lists and application databases.\nThreats\nFor each asset, threats that can reasonably be expected to apply to it will be identified. These vary depending on the type of asset and can be accidental events such as fires, floods, or vehicle impacts, or malicious attacks such as viruses, thefts, or sabotage.\nVulnerabilities\nThe circumstances that can be exploited by a specific threat will be described in detail. Examples of such vulnerabilities may include the lack of server patches (which could be exploited by the threat of hacking) or the existence of paper files in a data center (which could be exploited by the threat of fire).\nImpacts\nFinally, an estimate must be provided of the impact that the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could have on the asset.\nInformation Security Risk Assessment\nThe risk assessment proceeds through the following steps:\na) Identify potential risks;\nb) Understand (and make others understand) the likelihood and consequences of these risks;\nc) Prioritize the treatment of risks;\nd) Identify controls aimed at reducing risks below an acceptable level.\nThe risk analysis process allows for:\nIdentifying, classifying, and valuing assets to be protected;\nIdentifying and assessing hostile agents, threats, vulnerabilities, and risks;\nDetermining which threats need to be addressed and with which countermeasures (technical and non-technical);\nCalculating the residual risk, assessing acceptable levels, and defining countermeasures to keep the risk within these levels.\nRisk Analysis and Evaluation\nNumerical Classification\nTo assess the risk for an activity and determine the appropriate treatment, agilelab examines threats, vulnerabilities, the probability of the threat occurring, and the impact that would result. To describe the likelihood of a risk occurring and the impact it uses a scale that identifies the following risk levels:\nRisk Level\nLow < 20\n19 < Medium < 41\nHigh > 40\nRisks with a level below 20 are accepted, while others are analyzed in more detail.\nThe rationale for assigning probability and impact ratings will be provided so that they can be evaluated later to verify if they have changed substantially. This will also help ensure the consistency and repeatability of risk assessments.\nThe overall intention of risk assessment and proposed treatments is to reduce the risk classification to an acceptable level, such as from HIGH to MEDIUM or from MEDIUM to LOW.\nThe priorities of continuous improvement points are determined by the highest priority points addressed in the risk assessment. For example, if three points are addressed by a single action and one is MEDIUM and two are LOW, then the action's priority will be MEDIUM.\nRisk Assessment Report\nThe result of the risk analysis and evaluation phase is the risk assessment report. This report shows the following information:\nü Activities\nü Treatments\nü Vulnerabilities\nü Controls\nü Risk (including the rationale)\nü Impact (including the rationale)\nü Score\nü Classification\nü Whether the risk is accepted or requires actions\nThis report contributes to the Risk Treatment phase of the process and must be approved by Management before proceeding.\nThe risk management process, as depicted in the following diagram, consists of a series of blocks.\nRisk assessment is carried out through the MR 06.1.1 Information Risk Assessment.\nThe obtained risk level must be compared to the assessment criteria established by agilelab during the definition of the context. The results of the risk analysis are used to make decisions about future actions: whether a risk needs to be treated, the priority, and what actions need to be taken.\nContinuity of Operations Risk Assessment\nDescription of the Analysis Method\nThe analytical method on which the risk analysis is based consists of:\n1- Identifying the risks and opportunities present in the organization (depending on the context).\n2- Analyzing and prioritizing the risks and opportunities in the organization (What is acceptable? What is not?).\n3- Planning actions to address the risks (How can the risk be avoided or eliminated? How can it be mitigated?).\n4- Implementing the plan (conducting the actions).\n5- Monitoring the effectiveness of the actions (\"Does it work?\").\n6- Learning from experience (continuous improvement).\nRisk Assessment Report\nThe Risk Assessment Report represents the output of the risk analysis and contains a series of analytical indications.\nA 4x4 model (Probability x Damage) is used.\nProbability: It represents the likelihood of potential damages occurring. Probability will be defined according to the following scale:\nPROBABILITY VALUE DEFINITION INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFINITION\n1 Unlikely § Its occurrence would require the convergence of several events with low probabilities § No similar events have ever occurred § Its occurrence would be met with disbelief\n2 Low Probability § Its occurrence would require uncommon and unlikely circumstances § Few similar events have occurred § Its occurrence would cause modest surprise\n3 Probable § Other similar events have occurred § Its occurrence would cause modest surprise\n4 Very Likely § Other similar events have occurred § Its occurrence is practically taken for granted\nDamage: Possible effect caused by exposure to risk factors.\nThe extent of damage will be assessed according to the following scale:\nDAMAGE VALUE DEFINITION INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFINITION\n1 Ordinary § The incident does not cause significant service disruptions, and its impact on the company's operations is not relevant. The event can be resolved using ordinary means of intervention.\n2 Significant § Degradation or interruption of a minority percentage (< 25%) of the service, which continues to be provided albeit at a slower pace.\n3 Severe § Degradation or interruption of a percentage from medium to high (26% < x < 55%) of the service, causing serious disruptions.\n4 Catastrophic § Incident causing the interruption of a percentage from high to complete (56% < x < 100%) of the service.\nRisk: Probability that a potential level of damage will be reached under exposure to a hazard by the company.\nThe table below indicates the different combinations (PxD) between damage and the probabilities that it may occur (risk assessment).\nP (Probability)\n4 4 8 12 16\n3 3 6 9 12\n2 2 4 6 8\n1 1 2 3 4\n1 2 3 4 D (Damage)\nThe risk assessment is represented in Mod. 6.1.1.1 Management System Risk Assessment.\nCriteria for Analyzing Results\nFor each identified risk type, based on the parameters indicated above, objective risk parameters are identified for evaluations.\nRisk Assessment Action Required Timing\nUp to 3 Accept or mitigate the risk Medium to Long Term\nFrom 4 to 8 Mitigate or avoid the risk Short Term\nFrom 9 to 16 Avoid or transfer the risk Short Term"

    "text": "1.1 SCOPE\nDefining the management procedures for business continuity and disaster recovery.\nDESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES\n2.1 OPERATIONAL IMPACT ANALYSIS AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nThe information collected within the organization from an operational impact analysis and risk assessment provides the foundation for an effective business continuity management program.\nIn preparing the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and risk assessment process, the company defines risk scenarios, which are tools for predicting possible damage and the resulting involvement of the organization.\nThese scenarios are defined based on an understanding of the context and vulnerabilities, and based on reference events whose occurrence is considered more likely.\nThe evaluation of these risk scenarios, aimed at an immediate assessment of losses, is particularly important for defining the Business Continuity plan.\nThe company achieves its objectives by delivering its services to stakeholders. Therefore, it is important to create an understanding of the negative impact over time that the failure to deliver these products or services and associated activities could have on the organization's objectives and operations.\nThe BIA, which represents the analysis of operational impact, maps critical business processes (where critical does not mean less performing, but rather the most important or core business processes that, if not restored within the defined objectives, could compromise the organization's very survival). It identifies their level of criticality, impact on the business, recovery time (recovery time objectives), and the resources required for the service to be restored and continue at acceptable levels.\nFrom the BIA, the company defines specific indicators such as:\nMaximum Acceptable Outage (MAO)\nMaximum Tolerable Period of Disruption (MTPD)\nMinimum Business Continuity Objective (MBCO)\nRecovery Point Objective (RPO)\nRecovery Time Objective (RTO) \nThese indicators are necessary to define the Business Continuity Strategy and the Business Continuity Plan.\nIn addition to the BIA, the organization establishes, implements, and maintains a formal and documented risk assessment process that systematically identifies, analyzes, and evaluates the risks of disaster incidents for the organization.\n2.2 OPERATIONAL CONTINUITY STRATEGY\nDetermining the operational continuity strategy involves identifying the actions necessary to control the results of the operational impact analysis and risk assessment, in order to meet the organization's operational continuity objectives.\nThe determination and selection of an operational continuity strategy are based on the outcome of the operational impact analysis and risk assessment.\nThe consolidation, continuation, recovery, and resumption of priority activities consider other related activities and their supporting resources.\nThe Business Continuity strategy determines:\nProtection of priority activities\nStabilization, continuation, recovery, and resumption of priority activities and their dependencies\nMitigation, by responding to the impact through management \nThe determination of the strategy includes the approval of the timeline for activity resumption.\nThe company also evaluates the Business Continuity capabilities of suppliers that impact its business processes.\n2.3 BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN\nThe main contents of the Business Continuity Plan include:\nPurpose and scope\nCriteria for evaluating response effectiveness\nCriteria for activating the response\nResponse procedures\nCrisis management responsibilities\nCommunications\nInterfaces\nResources\nInformation flows \nThe Business Continuity Plan also includes the Disaster Recovery plan.\nIn particular, the Business Continuity Plan assesses:\nRoles, responsibilities, and authorities for each procedure/activity\nIncident management and crisis declaration\nContact information for each documented procedure\nCommunication methods\nImplementation procedure, identifying the actions and tasks to be performed \nThe company reviews procedures for the recovery of operational activities. The goal of recovery is to resume operational activities that support normal business operations following a disruptive event.\nReturn to normalcy can be achieved through:\nRepairing damages resulting from the incident\nMigrating activities from temporary locations to the main recovered location\nRelocating to a new location \n2.4 DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN\nThe Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan details the necessary phases for restoring the resources (hardware, software, infrastructure, etc.) used for service delivery by the company.\nThe DR plan outlines the operational procedures needed to accurately assess the emergency/disaster situation that prevents the normal delivery of services by the company.\nThe document \"Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan\" also describes the various phases for restoring the telecommunication system, recovering data, and configuring procedures to contain the emergency and initiate the subsequent return to normal operational conditions.\n2.5 EXERCISES AND TESTING\nThe company's business continuity procedures and related preparations cannot be considered reliable until they are verified through exercises, and their updates are guaranteed.\nExercising is essential to ensure that strategies, policies, plans, and procedures that have been implemented are adequate and can meet the business continuity objectives. Exercises promote teamwork, competence, confidence, and knowledge, involving those who may need to use the procedures.\nElements of exercises and testing include:\nExercise program\nExercises related to business continuity plans\nThe company has designed scenarios that meet the objectives of the exercises, using threats identified in the risk analysis or other appropriate events.\nThe company has determined:\nAnnual exercise program\nMinutes of exercises conducted, including evaluation of outcomes and analysis of any deviations from expectations."

    "text": "Gender Equality Policy\nAgile Lab S.r.l. Management, which has always been attentive to the evolution of the market and the needs of the business, has adopted and implemented a policy aimed at fostering gender equality.\nFrom the prominence of the related values comes the decision to establish and implement a management system in accordance with the UNI/PdR 125:2022 document \"Guidelines on the management system for gender equality,\" which establishes the measure, reporting and evaluation of gender-related data in organizations with the aim of closing the gaps found, as well as incorporating the new paradigm related to gender equality within organizations, so as to support a sustainable and lasting change over time.\nIn fact, the provision for the adoption and definition of a set of performance indicators (KPIs) concerning gender equality policies, in adherence with the peculiar characteristics of each organization, makes it possible to define and maximize specific objectives aimed at fostering the enhancement and protection of diversity, equal opportunities in the workplace, the pursuit of gender equality, and the empowerment of women.\nIn this regard, a Strategic Plan is defined and reviewed periodically, detailing the objectives identified and indicating the methods for their pursuit.\nA corporate committee for the promotion of gender equality, called Gender Equality Committee or Guiding Committee, is also established and is responsible for the implementation and maintenance of a dedicated management system. The Responsible for the system periodically reports to management on the activities carried out, ongoing and planned, including the surveys (KPIs) carried out periodically.\nAgile Lab S.r.l. Management, in collaboration with the Gender Equality Committee, has therefore decided to adopt a policy on gender equality as a reference for defining the general framework within which strategies and objectives concerning gender equality are identified.\nThe Agile Lab approach is based on the assignment of roles and responsibilities based on assessments derived from training, skills, experience, aptitude shown in the performance of activities, and development potential.\nIn this context, diversity, on the level of personal characteristics and cultural backgrounds, represents a value for the company, facilitating opportunities for confrontation, the development of multiple strategies and operating modes, the adoption of choices based on a best evaluation of the reference context. Diversity that constitutes an asset for the company and that cannot determine, in any way, inequality at the level of training, evaluation of results, remuneration, career level.\nBecause of the above, Agile Lab S.r.l. Management:\nundertakes to implement recruitment policies aimed at enhancing experience, skills and competencies in relation to the internal roles to be filled; in the selection of candidates, priority attention is given to meritocracy, with attention to the enhancement of diversity; the people involved in the selection phase expressly undertake to avoid biases that may negatively impact the process and to implement, in an effective manner, the principles on which gender equality is based;\nis committed to ensuring that staff have equal access to roles of responsibility with equal skills, qualifications and abilities;\nis committed to offering staff a fair level of remuneration in accordance with each employee's competence, skills and professional experience, with the aim of pursuing salary equity; in particular, the compensation process and, in general, incentive systems in the short and long term, are based on the recognition of achievements, skills, responsibilities, taking market levels as a reference;\nundertakes to implement performance appraisal processes based on constant dialogue between managers and employees, with the establishment of development plans free of elements of discrimination, but based exclusively on personal skills and, in general, on merit;\nis committed to ensuring mechanisms for job protection and maintaining the same salary level in the post-maternity period;\ndefines and implements specific activities to monitor career opportunities and salaries;\nmakes a concrete commitment to the family welfare of its staff, both in economic terms and in terms of flexible working hours and agile work; thus, the work-life balance, a key factor in supporting parenting and family care in general, is facilitated;\nis committed to training and raising awareness among staff on issues related to gender equality, such as inclusive language, gender stereotypes, prejudice, harassment, mobbing; the promotion of awareness on gender equality, in all areas of the company, is a value for Agile Lab, and the related responsibility is distributed among all staff and collaborators of the company;\nactivates specific training sessions on the subject of promoting inclusiveness;\nmakes available secure mechanisms for reporting any anomalies or critical issues that may jeopardize the pursuit of gender equality, such as event of harassment, mobbing or discrimination;\nis committed to communicating, both internally and externally, its willingness to pursue gender equality, value diversity, and support women's empowerment.\nAgile Lab S.r.l. Management strongly believes that an approach oriented towards gender equality, according to the actions outlined above, brings significant advantages: firstly, in terms of unconditional access to competent and qualified personnel, as well as an increase in the retention capacity of its employees and collaborators, in particular due to the support for work-life balance.\nThe presence of people of different genders, as well as of different cultures and ethnicities, promotes the creation of an environment in which the personal growth of each individual finds a wide space. It also facilitates the performance of internal work groups.\nA differentiated vision and the presence of multiple points of view constitute strategic elements for more effective and efficient risk management and for making more considered operational and strategic choices. Finally, the provision of objective ways of assigning internal roles and assessing performance allows for more balanced analyses of the internal articulation of functions and the results, from time to time, achieved by them.\nAgile Lab S.r.l. Management also undertakes to ensure that this policy is:\ncommunicated and disseminated within the organisation and to its stakeholders;\nsubject to training and awareness-raising for company management;\nupdated or confirmed periodically, during revision, on the basis of events, changes and the results of monitoring and audits;\ncoordinated by a responsible figure, designated by management and possessing organisational and gender expertise.\nIn order to pursue the gender equality policy, a specific strategic plan was defined for its implementation, setting up a management model that guarantees, over time, the maintenance of the defined requirements, measuring the progress of results through the preparation of specific KPIs. These were identified on the basis of the 6 thematic areas indicated by UNI/PdR 125:2022, namely:\nCulture and strategy: improving the work environment by fostering inclusion, gender equality and the enhancement of gender diversity, overcoming stereotypes, discrimination or prejudices (even unconscious) related to gender issues.\nGovernance: implementation of a governance model aimed at defining adequate organisational controls and the presence of the minority gender in the organisation's governing and control bodies, as well as the presence of processes aimed at identifying and remedying any form of non-inclusion.\nHR processes: implementation of HR processes relating to all aspects of the employment relationship such as recruitment, on-boarding, training, skills development, promotion, remuneration, termination, based on principles of inclusion and respect for diversity.\nGrowth opportunities and inclusion of women in the company: improvement of the organisation's ability to offer gender-neutral internal career and growth paths.\nGender pay equity: implementation of processes for gender pay equity, including benefits and welfare systems.\nParenting and work-life balance: implementation of policies to support staff in their parenting and caregiver activities.\nDiversity and plurality, for Agile Lab, represent a source of innovative ideas and high-level strategic approaches, as well as factors aimed at allowing equal opportunities for growth, on a personal and professional level, in objective and meritocratic terms.\nAn approach that promotes the development of internal competencies, the inclusion of managers with qualified skills, and the creation of an internal culture based on the values of diversity and inclusion, which in turn is an essential element for the sustainable growth of the company and, more generally, of the society in which it operates."
